National Parks hold a special place in our lives; so Thule\nis prepared for adventure with his backpack, and snacks! As we've\nbeen traveling, I have really grasped the importance of protecting\nand preserving our national parks, public lands and waterways.\nI painted Thule as a walking billboard, promoting healthy habitats\nand preservation of these wonderful places through various patches\non his backpack. I, too, collect patches as we travel, so it only seemed\nnatural to incorporate them into my otter design. Most are serious,\nbut take a look\ufffdthere are some fun ones, too!

My motivation is to create awareness for clean\nwater and healthy habitats for river otters, and all the creatures\nwe share our planet with. I have been particularly concerned with\nthe welfare of the Monarch butterfly. The food source in their\ncaterpillar stage, milkweed, is vanishing therefore significantly\nreducing the populations of Monarchs. I feel the need to surround\nmyself with these beautiful butterflies before they are all gone.\nSo I paint them. The inspiration for my design is from a YouTube\nvideo. It was a beautiful, joyful record of three otters mesmerized\nby a single butterfly, and chasing it all around.",

Between the late 1980s and 2010, KFA, with Felice as its leader, played major roles in the timber wars in northwest California and southwest Oregon, including timber sale appeals and litigation to defend roadless areas, the Northern Spotted owl controversy, and efforts to protect Ancient Forests through federal legislation. KFA championed conservation biology approaches to protecting biological diversity and the protection of biological corridors linking protected areas, including via development of the Klamath Corridors Proposal and through national forest plans. KFA also worked to protect and restore Pacific Salmon species, to promote watershed restoration and the restoration economy as an alternative to timber dependence, and to persuade the Forest Service to decommission logging roads that posed watershed risks. Volunteer watershed advocacy in the Salmon and Scott River Basin and participation in the federal Klamath River Basin Restoration Program by KFA co-founders Felice Pace and Petey Brucker grew into KFA's River Program. The collection includes Felice's prior work with California Indigenous American tribes and NGOs, Siskiyou County, the Marble Mountain Audubon Society and the Siskiyou Regional Education Project that promoted bioregionalism and published Siskiyou Country Magazine in the 1980s. It includes press clip series on national forest and Klamath River issues and information on operations of the anti-environmental Wise Use Movement in Northern California and Southern Oregon.",

    "Title": "Smith (Norman R.) Collection :",
    "Description": "Norman R Smith's son Chester V Smith died on November 9, 1918, of pneumonia at Camp Colt, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania; this appears to be the inspiration that drove his devoted father to begin a series of diaries, titled The Bridge, written from 1918 through 1938. Smith recorded daily activities, including the weather, from his Moonstone Beach retirement home as he boldly visioned the future development of the town of Trinidad. The diaries also were a vehicle for Smith to express his continuing grief at the loss of his son, as virtually every entry contains a variant of this (from Jan 1, 1933): ... My Dear Dad: Trust God and hold fast onto me. I am with you and the Lord is with You. Be not discouraged nor cast down, all is Well ... Chester. Norman R Smith was a well-traveled surveyor and engineer with pipe dreams. His father, Victor Smith, of the town of Port Angeles WA, was lost on the Brother Jonathan shipwreck off Crescent City. Norman Smith also wrote a family history: Victory: Biography of Victor Smith was published serially in the Port Angeles Evening News in 1950.",
