Rhetorical Advocacy and the Scholarship of Application,"Juergensmeyer, Erik","This article argues for an expanded understanding of academic labor as it aligns with Ernest Boyer’s concepts of the scholarship of engagement and the scholarship of application. It draws on theories of rhetorical advocacy and rhetorical ecologies in order to help academics participate more in their communities. It concludes by applying these concepts to a community advocacy project, demonstrating the importance of connecting scholarship and public work.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol1/iss1/7
“It’s Not as Rosy as I’d Like It to Be” A Literacy-and-Identity Case Study of a Contingent Academic (Not) Writing for Publication,"Vacek, Kathleen","For academics hovering between contingent and permanent status, getting publications on the CV can make the difference—or can it? Looking closely at engagement with professional academic literacy practices offers meaningful insights into academic labor. This article considers the case of a newly-minted PhD working a collection of contingent jobs while aspiring to publish and obtain a permanent position. In the face of a heavy teaching load and disheartening job search, Elle Stewart (a pseudonym), decides to put off writing. She disidentifies with the discourse of being an academic and disengages from professional academic literacy practices, despite a life history full of success with academic writing. This case study takes an academic literacies approach and uses a framework of discoursally constructed writer identity to consider how Elle’s literacies and identities mediate one another. While personalizing many of the dilemmas of contingent labor, the case study also considers Elle’s painful disconnection from research and the structural factors that lead her to feel shut out of professional academic writing.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol1/iss1/5

Contingency in Higher Education  Evidence and Explanation,"Shulman, Steven","This paper summarizes recent evidence on the trends in contingency in higher education. Contingent faculty employment, defined as the sum of full-time non-tenure track faculty employment and part-time faculty employment, increased both absolutely and relative to all faculty positions between 2002 and 2015, despite a modest downturn after 2011. The long-term growth of contingency since 2002 has primarily occurred in doctoral degree universities. The short-term decline in contingency since 2011 has primarily occurred in public associates’ degree colleges and in private for-profit colleges. The short-term decline in contingency since 2011 is due to the contraction of the for-profit sector combined with a one-time drop in public associates’ degree colleges. The explanation of the long-term growth of contingency as an inevitable response to financial exigency is rejected. Contingency has increased due to the priorities of higher education administrators, not state budget cuts or other drops in revenue.",adjunct faculty ; higher education ; Contingent faculty ; Labor Economics ; academic labor markets,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol1/iss1/3

"The Praxis of Deceleration Recovery as ""Inner Work, Public Act""","Cortez, Marisol, Ph.D.","Originally published in Deceleration and presented at the 2017 meeting of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment, this short essay details the vision and praxis behind an online journal of environmental justice co-edited by the author alongside environmental journalist Gregory Harman. In this essay, I situate the evolution of this project in relation to our precarious institutional positions as writers with disabilities who consequently work in the spaces between academia, journalism, activism, and creative writing. This positionality has in turn placed Deceleration in conversation with degrowth and allied movements around the world, which challenge the disabling productivism that regulates the temporal rhythms of not only academia and everyday life but also our modes of activist resistance. Inspired by these challenges, Deceleration envisions new ways of responding to environmental and political crises, grounding writing, thinking, and acting in a reinhabitation of biological time.",environmental justice ; Other Arts and Humanities ; independent scholarship ; disability ; degrowth ; care ; Environmental Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/7

Rhetorical Listening and Strategic Contemplation as Research Tools Learning from Edwin Hopkins and Early Attempts at Labor Reform in Composition,"Gerdes-McClain, Rebecca","This paper is a personal and historical study of the labor conditions of composition teachers, in which I present the work of Edwin Hopkins, a professor at the University of Kansas from 1889 to 1937, who collected data on composition teaching between 1909 and 1915 in an attempt to reform the labor conditions of composition teachers. The paper is necessarily personal because I employ rhetorical listening, developed by Krista Ratcliffe, and strategic contemplation, developed by Jaqueline Jones Royster and Gesa Kirsch, as research methods for engaging with historical and archival research. Both of these methods require careful analysis of my personal interests in and motivations for this research. This analysis of my personal interests and motivation takes two forms: (1) narrative vignettes of my own labor experiences, which I use to facilitate rhetorical listening, and (2) descriptive analyses of my reactions to my research, which document how strategic contemplation was enacted through my reflective practices. The reader should therefore be prepared for the paper to alternate between readings of Hopkins’ work and reflections on my own teaching and research. Using rhetorical listening and strategic contemplation, I evaluate Hopkins’ strategies for reforming labor conditions in the early twentieth century and what they offer compositionists interested in reforming our current labor conditions. I focus particularly on Hopkins’ attempts to persuade those outside the composition classroom that labor conditions in those classrooms were untenable and directly related the “problem” of unsatisfactory student writing, looking for resonances—my term for connections and similarities—between attempts to reform modern labor issues in the composition classroom and Hopkins’ strategies. Ultimately I argue that attempts at labor reform need to consider historical case studies, like Hopkins', when strategizing ways to improve the teaching conditions of writing instructors. Too often, attempts to improve labor conditions surrounding the teaching of writing ignore the rich and complex labor history of our field.",Composition Labor History ; Rhetoric and Composition ; Feminist Rhetorical Practices,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/4
FAST Professor Strategies for Surviving the Tenure Track,"Droz, Patricia Welsh ; Jacobs, Lorie Stagg","In response to Maggie Berg and Barbara Seeber’s 2016 manifesto on academic deceleration, The Slow Professor, the present article posits that the slow approach is dangerous for those seeking tenure, but is nevertheless a fruitful resistance philosophy to be adopted once tenure is achieved. For those seeking tenure, we advise an alternative philosophy, FAST professing, as a means to mediate workplace stress and offer to those on the tenure-track a pragmatic alternative to premature slow professing. We outline the nature of the stress in today’s academic climate, suggest identifying the major sources of stress, and finally, offer strategies to streamline the workday and maintain life work balance en route to tenure.",tenure survival ; slow professor ; tenure-track ; Rhetoric and Composition ; professorship ; strategies for success ; academy ; workplace stress,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/6
Terms of Time for Composition A Materialist Examination of Contingent Faculty Labor,"Priest, Jesse","Bruce Horner’s seminal book, Terms of Work for Composition: A Materialist Critique provided Comp-Rhet WPAs with a methodology for infusing our conversations about work and labor with a holistic understanding of how these reflect on the lived experiences of students, teachers and administrators. Drawing on empirical data including surveys of contingent faculty at a large northeastern research university, as well as textual analysis of teaching material and an NCTE position statement, I propose the inclusion of a materialist-oriented conceptualization of time to the discussion began by Horner and others. Using the lens of how time is allocated, I argue for a wider understanding of the separations between how institutions and contingent teaching faculty (including graduate teaching assistants) view the importance of their labor, and discuss implications for curricular and departmental design.",Evaluation ; contingent faculty ; and Research ; composition ; Rhetoric and Composition ; administration ; labor ; Educational Assessment ; Higher Education Administration,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/5

"""Collegiality as a Dirty Word? Implementing Collegiality Policies in Institutions of Higher Education""","Wooten, Courtney Adams ; Condis, Megan A","Abstract: Collegiality is integral to the healthy functioning of any academic department and is a necessary professional attribute for new faculty, who often spent their graduate school careers with relatively little involvement in institutional politics, to develop. However, the recent trend to explicitly outline tenure and promotion requirements for collegial behavior gives us pause. We question if a collegiality statement for tenure and promotion could function as yet another obstacle between faculty from background that have historically been underrepresented in the academy (women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, people with disabilities, etcetera) and their bids for tenure.",Gender ; Feminist ; collegiality ; and Sexuality Studies ; Ethnicity and Post-Colonial Studies ; Rhetoric and Composition ; Technical and Professional Writing ; discrimination ; tenure and promotion ; labor ; Disability and Equity in Education ; academia ; Race,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/3

"Academic Collective Bargaining Status, Process, and Prospects","Julius, Daniel J. ; DiGiovanni, Nicholas, Jr.","The authors provide a perspective, as scholars and practitioners, of the organizational, demographic, legal and contextual variables that inform the past and the future of faculty unions in U.S. colleges and universities. They ask, how best to conceptualize and evaluate the impact of faculty unions; from the inception of academic unionization in the 1960’s to the present, and further, what is known and not known about collective bargaining. Issues examined include: factors that influence negotiation processes, governance, bargaining dynamics, the institutional and demographic factors associated with faculties who vote in unions, compensation and the legal status of graduate student unions. Collective bargaining with faculty is viewed through a wider lens of “craft unionism” as it is known in the industrial labor relations context. An effort is made to review contemporary subjects and challenges engaging the parties during negotiations in the second decade of this century. The paper offers an analysis of the impact of collective bargaining on changes in decision making processes and forums, and offers insight into the kinds of management strategies most effective in organized environments. Last, the authors ask what is new about negotiations and what has remained the same over the past 45 years.",Collective Bargaining ; Education ; Higher Education ; Labor Relations ; Unions,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/11

(Mis)Alignments Between Institutional Mission Statements and Service Learning Handbooks,"Iglesias, Charisse S","Institutions self-identifying as social justice advocates are expected to perform social justice roles through their disciplines, policies, and actions (Feldman, 2008). Applying Tania Mitchell’s critical service learning framework (2008), this study examines (mis)alignments between service learning handbooks and their respective institutional mission statements. The first phase was a critical discourse analysis of the service learning handbooks to measure expressions of reciprocity. The second phase was a content analysis of the corresponding institutional mission statements to analyze conceptions of community engagement, social justice, etc. Findings reveal how institutions frame handbooks, considers how that framing undermines reciprocity, and analyzes how universities practice what they preach by evaluating perception and performance.

Snapshots of #WPALife Invisible Labor and Writing Program Administration,"McIntyre, Megan","Writing program administration work is a significant reality for many within the field of rhetoric and composition, and though such work has long been part of our disciplinary fabric, it often remains invisible to departments and institutions. In this article, I offer two brief snapshots of how writing program administration work is often obscured by seemingly brief documents or interactions, which elide the complex communicative and political work at the heart of program administration. I then offer a hashtag-based Twitter community, #WPALife, as one potential way of making this work more visible and of building the capacity to create more just, equitable, and anti-racist writing programs. Visibility can’t be an end in and of itself; rather, making this work visible allows me to be a more effective advocate for equitable and anti-racist practices in my program, institution, university system, and discipline.",Twitter ; writing program administration ; invisible labor ; Other Rhetoric and Composition ; digital community,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/8
Sustaining Community-Engaged Projects Making Visible the Invisible Labor of Composition Faculty,"Corey, Jessica Rose ; George, Barbara","Increasingly, service-learning, community-engaged projects, or community-engaged learning are encouraged in higher education as part of HIPs, or High Impact Practices. While the authors' experiences with service-learning or community-engaged learning in our composition courses have been positive, and while student engagement is generally acknowledged as a desirable outcome of any pedagogy, we posit that there are questions about the labor system needed to sustain such practices. We use narratives to reflect upon our experiences holding various identity positions within academia (from graduate student, adjunct, to NTT and TT positions), and research about the work involved with community engaged projects, to interrogate the invisible labor of such projects within composition. By making these labor practices explicit, we can theorize and, just as importantly, practice more equitable and sustainable community-engaged projects in composition.",community-engaged projects ; faculty labor ; composition ; high impact learning practices ; service-learning ; labor ; Higher Education ; community engagement,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/6

Instructional Spending Per Student  Patterns and Explanations,"Shulman, Steven","Most students know what they spend on tuition and other costs of attending college, but most do not know how much their colleges spend on their education in return. This paper provides figures on instructional spending per full-time equivalent student, broken down by institutional level and sector. Variations in this measure of educational spending can be substantial even among apparently similar institutions. A cross-sectional multiple regression model utilizing 2016 IPEDS data on every public and private non-profit college and university in the United States is used to explore the possible causes of these variations. It shows that instructional spending per student rises with the portion of the budget devoted to instruction. It falls with the non-tenure track portion of the instructional staff, with the prevalence of students from low-income backgrounds, and with tuition as a fraction of total revenue. These findings are mostly as expected, but most of the variation in instructional spending per student is still unexplained.",Economics,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/12
Away with the Apprentice Graduate Worker Advocacy Groups and Rhetorical Representation,"Marburger, Zachary B","While graduate workers have a long history of organizing and advocating on their own behalf, concerns specific to their unique identity as both laborers and students have not yet permeated the discourse surrounding worker rights in higher education. Using Edward Schiappa’s work on how definitions are created and circulated, I position that the work and labor of the graduate student is under-discoursed because of the mundane definition of the graduate worker as an apprentice first and foremost. Drawing on the public literature of the Committee on Rights and Compensation (CRC), a current effort to unionize graduate workers underway at the University of Colorado Boulder, I examine the ways in which the CRC is attempting to introduce previously hidden, novel definitions of the graduate worker as a professional first and foremost.",unions ; definitions ; University of Colorado Boulder ; academic labor ; rhetoric ; Rhetoric ; collective bargaining ; graduate workers ; Other Rhetoric and Composition ; Non-Tenure Track Faculty ; Edward Schiappa,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/9
Intergroup Solidarity and Collaboration in Higher Education Organizing and Bargaining in the United States,"Scott, Daniel ; Kezar, Adrianna J","For too long in higher education, different worker groups have conceived of themselves as separated by distinct, even competing interests. The isolation between groups reduces communication, fosters unawareness of common interests, and hinders their ability to effectively collaborate in solidarity, as does the divided and largely independent structure of the unions and bargaining units representing them. Without greater collaboration and solidarity, members of the higher education community are less able to resist the harmful trends that have been transforming the sector over the previous decades, subjecting them to increasingly similar working conditions and distancing higher education from its student learning, community service, and research missions. We propose a combination of elements from anarcho-syndicalist and social justice organizing approaches, centering intergroup solidarity and a flexible commitment to shared missions, as ways for higher education workers to build greater power and have a greater influence on the transformations occurring across higher education.",unions in higher education ; Collective Bargaining ; organizing strategies ; Labor History ; collectivism ; Higher Education ; Unions,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/10

Administrative Rhetorical Mindfulness A Professional Development Framework for Administrators in Higher Education,"Beavers, Melvin E","As part of the post-secondary educational landscape, online programs and courses help institutions reach and enroll more students. To meet the needs of increased enrollments in online education, part-time faculty are often hired to teach online courses. Part-time contingent faculty represent a growing majority across many fields of study in colleges and universities. As Rendahl & Breuch reported, first-year courses, specifically freshman composition, are increasingly taught online. This study uses a mixed-methods design to examine how, and in what ways, writing program administrators (WPAs) approach preparing part-time faculty to teach writing online.

Contingent Faculty Performing Scholarship and Service Examining Academic Labor and Identity at a Public Flagship University,"Wilson, Sarah Bartlett ; Smith, C. Veronica","The faculties of many colleges and universities in the United States are comprised of rising numbers of instructional contingent faculty who are ineligible for tenure. Although these positions generally do not require scholarly or service activities because their primary focus is teaching, the extent to which these faculty members still choose to perform like tenure-line faculty, with at least some kind of balance of teaching, research, and service, is understudied. The current study attempted to address this omission in the literature by collecting data from contingent faculty members at a public flagship university (N = 176) about their engagement with scholarly and service activities. A majority of the respondents (63.1%) had engaged in at least one scholarly activity and in at least one service activity (69.9%). This study adds to our understanding of the lived experiences of contingent faculty and concludes that a majority of these faculty members are, at least in part, building an academic identity based off of traditional expectations and activities for tenure-line faculty.",Faculty Performance ; Scholarship ; Service ; Other Education ; Research ; Contingent Faculty ; Academic Identity ; NTT Faculty ; Non-Tenure-Track Faculty ; Academic Labor,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol5/iss1/10

More specifically, we argue that communication itself (i.e., literally listening, speaking, and writing) becomes emotionally-laden work amid the research, teaching, and service performed by critical women scholars. We aim, through our articulation of communication labor, to disrupt dominant narratives of what faculty work lives should be, and we call for a paradigm shift in the way faculty labor is socially constructed so that we can improve critical women faculty’s success and well-being.",communicative labor ; Communication ; gender ; Organizational Communication ; emotional labor ; faculty work ; critical scholarship,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol5/iss1/3

Emotions in Academic Writing/Care-Work in Academia Notes Towards a Repositioning of Academic Labor in India (& Beyond),"Gupta, Anuj","In this article I seek to reflect on a rupture that happened in my college-level writing classroom in India when a student chose to write about her experience of rape and accompanying life-long trauma in a literacy narrative assignment. This rupture, and the ways in which I struggled to engage with it, were initially discomforting but eventually led to strong convictions about the need to reposition academic writing and labor in Indian universities in a manner that sees the epistemic value of emotions in academic writing and the ethical value of care-work in academia as essential ingredients required to create a socially just world. Both ingredients have the potential to counter the debilitating effects that trauma has on students' abilities to learn and succeed in college, especially for those who are at a higher risk for mental distress due to their marginalized positionalities. Through a thick description of my experiences, I explore the rationale for the call to reposition academic labor; share some practically feasible suggestions which teachers and administrators motivated to work towards social justice can use to experiment in their classrooms; and end by reflecting on the limitations and challenges involved in such experimentation.",writing pedagogy ; india ; trauma ; Nonfiction ; Reading and Language ; emotional labour ; Other Rhetoric and Composition ; literacy narratives,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol5/iss1/7

"Recent sediments of Humboldt Bay, Eureka, California","Thompson, Robert Wayne","Humboldt Bay is a coastal lagoon, 14 mi. long and a maximum of 4 mi. wide. The bay has three distinct segments, South, Entrance, and Arcata Bays, each of which occupies the seaward end of one or more stream valleys cut into Plio- Pleistocene paralic sediments. The segments are linked by narrow tidal channels which are bounded by a barrier spit on the west and by high valley interfluves on the east. Climate of the area is rainy temperate . Tides are of the mixed type with a mean range of 6.5 ft.
Textural variations of the surface sediments in South and Arcata Bays correlate generally with bay-floor morphology. Bottoms of the inward branching tidal channels are covered by gravelly, shelly sand which becomes finer and more muddy with increasing distance from t he tidal inlet. Clayey silt predominates on the tidal flats, and highly organic silty clay or clayey peat occurs in the few remaining salt marshes. Tidal flat sediments are olive gray to black and thoroughly stirred by the rich bay infauna. The general pattern of decreasing grain size with increased elevation and distance away from the inlet is controlled by tidal currents. Exceptions to the general pattern and marked textural differences between tidal flat sediments in various of the bay segments result from: direct sediment discharge by entering streams, variable intensi ty of wave action, corrmercial oyster harvesting, and variations in flushing time. Dredged channels have larger components of both gravel and mud than their undredged counterparts.
Study of old maps and aerial photographs coupled with nearly ubiquitous evidence of marsh erosion indicate the bay is in approximate equilibrium, that is, filling at rates the order of 0.2-0.4 cm/yr commensurate with relative sea level rise. Most of the sediment comes indirectly from the Eel and Mad Rivers by way of littoral and tidal currents . Direct measurements show local accretion and erosion rates up to 4 cm/ yr and 11 cm/yr respectively. These fluctuate on a seasonal basis in response to alternating wind-wave patterns and reflect 'in-bay' relocation of materials.
Presence of extensive tidal flats and salt marsh imply former higher rates of accretion and bay infill. The recent change toward equilibrium conditions may relate to sediment removal by dredging and/or to a reduction in sed iment supply caused by northward shift of the Mad River course.",Pacific Ocean -- Humboldt Bay ; Humboldt Bay (Calif.) ; Environmental Sciences ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Oceanography ; Oceanography -- California -- Humboldt Bay ; Geography ; Sedimentation and deposition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/archivepub/12

"Humboldt Holding Up Duane Flatmo Says Goodbye to ‘El Pulpo Mecanico’ and Looks Back on His Life as a Muralist, Kinetic Sculpture Racer and Celebrity Elbow Rubber","Flatmo, Duane ; McGeary, Stephanie ; Goff, Andrew","""Sending your child off into the scary world when they reach the age of maturity brings with it mixed emotions. Oh, they grow up so fast, don’t they? Sure, you’re excited for them to go out and test their independent selves but it’s natural to worry, even when your offspring is a giant, flaming metal octopus. Did I raise them well enough to burn the world down out there without me?
Such were the feelings experienced recently by Humboldt’s most famous artist Duane Flatmo. After a decade blazing his way into the hearts of fans of his El Pulpo Mecanico art car — a period that included many trips to Burning Man and various festivals — Duane inked a lucrative deal that a few weeks back sent his most-celebrated creation from its birthplace in Eureka to its new permanent home in Austin, Texas where it will flame on under new management.
“It’s very bittersweet watching this go because it’s pretty much the pinnacle of what I’ve ever built in my life as an artist,” Flatmo told the Outpost as he loaded the machine on a pair of flatbed trucks for the last time. “I got paid well which for it which allows me now to carry on and make something else.”
On this week’s edition of Humboldt Holding Up — LoCO’s Zoom-aided, lo-fi pandemic-era podcast attempt — Flatmo opens up about saying adios to his fiery eight-armed baby and discusses how its success changed his life. Topics on this week’s podcast include:   The life and times of El Pulpo Mecanico Duane’s beginnings as a Humboldt County sign painter Finding success as a muralist and kinetic sculpture racer Celebrities Duane has managed to brush up against How his guitar “style” has landed him on national television on multiple occasions More!

Humboldt Holding Up Let’s Talk Psychedelics! Arcata City Councilmember Sarah Schaefer on the Council’s Recent Decriminalization of Entheogens,"Goff, Andrew ; McGeary, Stephanie ; Schaefer, Sarah","""
You’ve probably heard by now that the Arcata City Council recently passed a resolution decriminalizing the use of psychedelic plants and fungi (if you haven’t, read about it here), an item that was brought forward by advocacy group Decriminalize Nature Humboldt with support from City Councilmember Sarah Schaefer.
“I think it’s a really important ideological stand against the war on drugs and against the fact that we vilify any drug and anybody who uses them since the 1970s,” Councilmember Schaefer told the Outpost. “Plants — like psilocybin, like mescaline, like ayahuasca — have been used in traditional ceremonies, for religious purposes, as rights of passage for cultural events for societies for millenia. And so it just doesn’t make sense that these plants and fungi would be illegal and would be such the center of controversy.”
On this week’s episode of Humboldt Holding Up — the Outpost’s lo-fi, but high-potency podcast — Schaefer dives deeper into her reasons for supporting this resolution, her appreciation for the history and uses of psychedelics and how she hopes this can help the people in her town seek alternative options to improve their mental health and well-being.
Of course, the councilmember cares about a lot of other issues and touches on other topics, including:   The City of Arcata’s plans for $4.4 million in ARPA funds  Establishing a safe parking program in Arcata to help the homeless Housing needs and plans for development of Arcata’s “Gateway District” What it’s been like to enter city council during the pandemic Her early local fame winning the Oyster Festival’s oyster calling contest at age seven""",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/covid/134

She ultimately obtained her degree, but it was her unwavering desire to work on boats in Humboldt Bay that led her to the role she enjoys now.
“I went down to the marina here at Woodley Island and just kind of hung out on the docks bugging random fishermen, asking for work,” Tonning told the Outpost. “I got laughed at a lot.”
On this week’s episode of Humboldt Holding Up, LoCO’s good enough podcast, we trace the story of how Tonning earned the attention of ubiquitous local mariner Leroy Zerlang — who would go on to bestow her with her more well-known moniker, “Captain Zippo” — to obtaining her captain’s license at age 27, to eventually going on to helm the MV Madaket, Humboldt’s beloved historic pleasure cruiser.

For Linda Cooley, Yurok tribal member and Mad River’s new CEO, the acquisition has been a dream, as its led to her seeing her people represented in spaces where they’ve historically been invisible.

However, Papa and Barkley grow, distribute, and sell a product. They are also one of the only businesses that provide products nationwide. They are a good business to look back on because they are paving the way for federal legalization, and their role during the pandemic is making it possible. The Cannabis industry is labeled as an essential business during the pandemic, which is a feat. Michael Kraft describes their responsibilities as an essential business and the safety protocols they impose on the employees. Kraft also explains the change in sales and service as the pandemic started and continued over the months leading up to the interview. It is informative from the perspective of distribution management and in sales minus the retail aspect. They have an online retail presence, which is important because the pandemic has moved many resources online so the fact that Cannabis has an online presence makes it more accessible. This research can not only contribute to the research of the economy during the pandemic, but it can also contribute to the history of the Cannabis industry. The United States is on track towards federalizing it legally, and if that happens, it can help explain why it was legalized and its benefits for the future.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/covid/15

Analysis of the Variables Affecting Plant Species Richness in Deserts,"Kallison, Eli R ; Thompson, Ellen ; Keen, Maddison ; Newman, Rusty","There are many hypotheses that attempt to explain patterns of species diversity in different environments. Deserts are a great place to study changes in species richness because they are relatively nutrient bare and exhibit low precipitation. This barebones environment means that slight shifts in climate and geography may lead to clear changes in species richness. We investigate how temperature, precipitation, water and light availability, latitude, elevation and other variables affect plant species richness in 20 deserts.",botany ; plants ; deserts ; Botany ; R ; multiple regression ; biogeography ; richness ; ecology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/3

"Exploration of Antiviral Effects of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases 3, 4 and 5 in Arabidopsis.","Kallison, Eli R ; Beric, Aleksandra ; Meyers, Blake","Small RNAs play a number of vital roles in plants, including viral resistance. A particular class of small RNA that regulates plant defense from pathogens, among other functions, is known as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). A key player in the biogenesis pathway of siRNAs are RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases (RDRs). There are six RDR proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, three of which have well documented roles (RDRs 1, 2 and 6), and three of which have no documented role. Here, we look at the functions of the unstudied RDRs, RDRs 3, 4 and 5, to see whether they affect antiviral resistance.",plant biology ; RNA dependent RNA polymerases ; molecular genetics ; Plant Biology ; siRNA ; molecular biology ; small RNA ; plant pathology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/4

In this experiment, we compared the percent coverage of algae and shelled organisms within a quadrat surrounding three types of predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus, Dermasterias imbricata, and Lepasterias hexactis) to determine their habitat based on predatory behavior. Our data showed a significant difference in algae and shelled organism coverage between different species of sea star; shelled organism percent coverage was less than algae percent coverage in all species of sea stars. The niche, or role and position a species plays in its environment, of each star ultimately influenced the frequency and diversity of other recorded organisms.",Pisaster ochraceus ; intertidal ; asteroids ; algae coverage ; Marine Biology ; gastropod ; arthropod,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/5
Percolation in Carbon Nanotube Networks,"Grieder, William P ; Gannett, Will ; Saunders, Ruth","Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have become increasingly useful in different applications since they were discovered in 1991 by Sumio Iijima [1]. One of their many useful qualities is their electronic properties [2]. These CNTs, when formed into a network, can be used as transistors [3] or biosensors [4]. Transistors are devices that regulate either current flow or voltage and act as a switch; they are a crucial component of computers. Biosensors detect the presence of biomolecules. Efficient transistors and biosensors already exist; however, they are expensive to manufacture compared to these CNT networks. The ability of the CNT networks to be transistors or biosensors relies on the percolation properties of the networks. As long as these networks percolate, current can pass through the network from a source electrode to a drain electrode, which can then be modulated by an electrical or biological signal to make devices such as transistors useful.",Physics ; percolation theory ; nano networks ; percolation ; nano ; carbon nanotube,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/10

The Biocultural Trauma Feedback Loop,"Irvine, Michelle","It is widely known that trauma is repeated throughout a victim’s life, but the biological mechanisms of its recurrence (revictimization), even though understood biologically, are not accepted or discussed in all disciplines. A combination of socio-cultural and biological perspectives is needed to understand this cycle of revictimization and to offer help for sufferers and public health agencies. In order to better understand these issues, I conducted a synthesis of existing scientific research regarding the discrepancies between biological and sociological studies on revictimization. Within my review of sociological research it was revealed that initial trauma and revictimization are clearly understood as a positive feedback loop, with one increasing the other over a victim’s life. In biology, however, this loop has been acknowledged but the study of the recurrence of trauma has not been integrated into these disciplines. In humans, biology and sociology are inseparable; a recognition in these disciplines that a positive feedback loop exists regarding revictimization is key. Recognizing the existence of this biological feedback loop has the potential to mitigate the damage of past, present, and future trauma. With a better understanding of the biological aspects of their recurring trauma, devastated sufferers can be empowered against damaging ideologies, such as biological determinism and victim blaming.",positive feedback loop ; revictimization ; Anthropology ; trauma,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/1

Combined Use of Data From Avian Surveys Along the Pacific Crest Trail With Biodiversity Repositories to Model Habitat Suitability Throughout Northern California,"Pruhsmeier, Holli N ; McGrann, Michael C ; Graham, Jim","Models that describe species distributions are valuable in guiding management decisions. We compared and combined two avian datasets during the 2010 breeding season in northern California, USA. These datasets were a large-scale avian diversity survey from McGrann and Furnas (2016; 2018) and combined data from Biological Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Our objective was to compare the utility of these two datasets, that employ separate field protocols, to model habitat use for the Black-headed Grosbeak, Hairy Woodpecker, and Yellow-rumped Warbler, three common forest birds in our study area that occupy distinctive habitat types. We also tested whether combining the datasets together would create a model with greater generality over the study area and determine if the data will create response curves that explain certain relationships between environmental characteristics and species occurrences. We found that fine-scale data along a single, albeit extensive, transect built models that predicted suitability well for the section of trail, but did not predict occurrences well for areas beyond the trail in two of the three species. We also found that data from Biological Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) did not have the sampling structure required for finer scale modeling and lacked observations in areas that may be critical for sampling, such as fire-impacted areas. By combining these two datasets, we produced models that captured the range of these species throughout the study area, and we created response curves that explained anticipated habitat associations for each species.",passerines ; BlueSpray ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; woodpeckers ; habitat suitability modeling ; MaxEnt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol5/iss1/3
"Cannabis Tourism and the Community Resident Attitudes in Humboldt County, California","Pachmayer, Ara ; Switzer, Reed ; Reilly, Shawn","Resident attitudes towards cannabis tourism in Humboldt County, California were investigated in this exploratory study. The primary purpose was to understand if the variables used to explain resident attitudes towards tourism would show similar patterns when applied to cannabis tourism. The study included a questionnaire distributed to adult residents of Humboldt County and was conducted between March and August 2017, just prior to recreational cannabis sales beginning in California. Correlations and crosstabs were performed on the data. While personal benefit was found to have an impact on resident attitudes towards cannabis tourism, other variables indicate mixed support which suggests that some variables may behave differently when considering cannabis tourism. Managerial implications are also considered.",cannabis tourism ; resident attitudes ; community ; tourism ; Leisure Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol5/iss1/6
A Clash of Cultures The Struggle of Native Americans to Participate in Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Western Science Under California’s Marine Life Protection Act,"Corbett, John W. ; Maloney, Ruthie A.","This article comprehensively details the culture clash that took place between Native Americans, the North Group Science Panel, and the Science Advisory Team (SAT) involved in the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). In 1999, the California Legislature passed the Marine Life Protection Act to create a statewide, science-driven network of marine reserves along the 1,100 miles of the California coast. The MLPA was meant to protect marine areas from overharvesting, and an initiative was formed to create a state marine reserve system advised by regional science panels. The science panel, a public body, decided that Native Americans science was not credible, they would not be allowed to present papers or be heard, and would be confined to policy statements for consideration by non-scientific entities. This complete denial of Tribal epistemologies is characteristic of settler colonialism.
As a public body, the SAT, contrary to State constitutional provisions, violated public meeting laws. The Tribes did not accept the SAT denial and historically large protests were held. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), modeling, and science by qualified individuals and Ph.D. marine scientists were rejected by the SAT. The SAT Levels of Protection (LOP) model greatly exaggerated take and harvest to levels that are not plausible. They extrapolated data, such as salmon by-catch numbers from another region other than the Klamath Management Zone, with questionable results. Tribal testimony would have noted and corrected SAT model flaws and resulted in more competent science.
The Best Available Science assumptions used by the SAT disregarded recommendations of inclusiveness by the National Science Foundation, which is used by federal agencies. After rejecting Native American anthropological reports, the SAT initiated their own study that violated numerous provisions of the 1974 Human Research Act. This case study demonstrates considerable advantages to SATs by allowing TEK presentations to science advisory bodies, instead of undertaking such studies solely by a SAT. There has never been an apology for the systematic discrimination detailed in this article. We conclude that science, although it has an important role to play in the development of Natural Resource regulations, must be impartial, open to all, and accepting of TEK––including Tribal monitoring results, fishing logs, survey data and modeling. Submitted materials must be judged upon the quality of the work, not the ethnic or racial background of the submitter. Although subsequent California Fish and Game Commission and Department actions to improve Tribal relations have been implemented, these programs do not address the issues raised in this article.",Environmental Monitoring ; MLPA ; Statistical Methodology ; Marine ; Native Americans ; stakeholder ; Other Social and Behavioral Sciences ; MPA ; Other Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; science-based management ; Environmental Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol5/iss1/7

"Gallup, Bill","Gallup, Bill","Mr. Gallup talks about his upbringing in the Humboldt Bay area. He lists the names of many boats and their captains. He recounts some stories and details about living and working in the shipping industry. In particular he goes into vivid visual descriptions of the business happening around Arcata Wharf/Arcata Dock. Announcer reveals a “surprise” about Bill being a member of the “Alaska Yukon Sourdoughs,” a brotherhood of Alaskan pioneers. Gallup talks on his views of Alaska as a “frontier for America” and how the Sourdoughs are involved. He goes on to describe the need for roads to expand the mining industry in Northern California. Mentions some of the minerals being exchanged between Northern California and Alaska. Gallup talks about his time as a farmer for a brief moment. He says that the mining industry “ruins the ground” and needs reforms with regard to the ecology of topsoil. He highlights the importance of health in the communities surrounding mines and those who work in them. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/old_timers/1005/thumbnail.jpg",Oral History ; Agricultural and Resource Economics ; Northern California ; Forest Management ; History ; Mining,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/old_timers/6

Place Based Learning Community Planning Guide,"Goldenberg, Katlin ; Matthews, Jessica ; Palomera, Raven ; Margell, Steven ; Gorman, Alex ; Sprowles, Amy ; Johnson, Matt","The introduction of Place Based Learning Communities (PBLCs) at HSU in 2015 has become an increasingly discussed topic throughout the university. We use the term “Learning Community” in its strictest sense - a curricular approach to education that intentionally links a cluster of courses around an interdisciplinary theme and enrolls a common cohort of students. The production of higher GPAs and retention and significant achievement gap closure among the HSU PBLC cohorts is undeniable.
All components are comprehensive in the fact that they build a sense of community, belonging, and accountability within the students which serve as factors for higher retention and academic success. Each class, event, study session, field trip, and staff and faculty member are all parts of what make PBLC such a success. There are many components that need to be established and collaborations that need to be formed in order to make student achievement possible. In this manual, you will read what these components and collaborations look like and upon conclusion you will understand what goes into creating a successful Place Based Learning Community.",Educational Methods ; Higher Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reports/1

"Recent sediments of Humboldt Bay, Eureka, California","Thompson, Robert Wayne","Humboldt Bay is a coastal lagoon, 14 mi. long and a maximum of 4 mi. wide. The bay has three distinct segments, South, Entrance, and Arcata Bays, each of which occupies the seaward end of one or more stream valleys cut into Plio- Pleistocene paralic sediments. The segments are linked by narrow tidal channels which are bounded by a barrier spit on the west and by high valley interfluves on the east. Climate of the area is rainy temperate . Tides are of the mixed type with a mean range of 6.5 ft.
Textural variations of the surface sediments in South and Arcata Bays correlate generally with bay-floor morphology. Bottoms of the inward branching tidal channels are covered by gravelly, shelly sand which becomes finer and more muddy with increasing distance from t he tidal inlet. Clayey silt predominates on the tidal flats, and highly organic silty clay or clayey peat occurs in the few remaining salt marshes. Tidal flat sediments are olive gray to black and thoroughly stirred by the rich bay infauna. The general pattern of decreasing grain size with increased elevation and distance away from the inlet is controlled by tidal currents. Exceptions to the general pattern and marked textural differences between tidal flat sediments in various of the bay segments result from: direct sediment discharge by entering streams, variable intensi ty of wave action, corrmercial oyster harvesting, and variations in flushing time. Dredged channels have larger components of both gravel and mud than their undredged counterparts.
Study of old maps and aerial photographs coupled with nearly ubiquitous evidence of marsh erosion indicate the bay is in approximate equilibrium, that is, filling at rates the order of 0.2-0.4 cm/yr commensurate with relative sea level rise. Most of the sediment comes indirectly from the Eel and Mad Rivers by way of littoral and tidal currents . Direct measurements show local accretion and erosion rates up to 4 cm/ yr and 11 cm/yr respectively. These fluctuate on a seasonal basis in response to alternating wind-wave patterns and reflect 'in-bay' relocation of materials.
Presence of extensive tidal flats and salt marsh imply former higher rates of accretion and bay infill. The recent change toward equilibrium conditions may relate to sediment removal by dredging and/or to a reduction in sed iment supply caused by northward shift of the Mad River course.",Pacific Ocean -- Humboldt Bay ; Humboldt Bay (Calif.) ; Environmental Sciences ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Oceanography ; Oceanography -- California -- Humboldt Bay ; Geography ; Sedimentation and deposition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/archivepub/12

The History of the Trinity Highway A Study in Transportation Dynamics,"Wilutus, Richard","Although the primary focus of this thesis is a history of California 299--the Trinity Highway, I have studied the construction of that road in the context of the history of transportation between Weaverville and Humboldt Bay. The history of a transportation network is not only a history of connections between people and places but also, in this remote region, the vital link connecting wilderness with civilization.
Ever since the settlement of the Weaverville area in 1848, its residents have sought reliable transportation to Humboldt Bay's seaport and merchandise. During this period a road has connected these two places for less than half that time; only since 1923 has it been possible to travel by road from the sea inland to the seat of Trinity County. Consequently a history of the Trinity Highway must include sufficient background to explain the delay in building this route, despite the acknowledged need for such an artery by the area's residents and both local and state governments. Thus when I refer to the Trinity Highway, I am, in fact , alluding to the more general concept of a transportation link that directly connects the two areas.
This thesis attempts to accomplish the following goals: 1) present a history of the development of transportation within the Humboldt-Trinity cultural and physical landscape; iv 2) analyze the dynamics of route location with an emphasis on the construction of Highway 299; and 3) show and explain the significance of the highway on economic and cultural patterns.
A history of a road connotes a description of the labor, materials, and mechanical construction of the route. While construction techniques and problems are discussed, prefer to study the history of transportation from a more humanistic approach. By determining the needs and desires of the population in relation to actual transportation improvements over time, I can reconstruct and interpret much of the region's cultural and economic history.
While, in a sense, this thesis is a regional history, the study will be limited exclusively to the effects of transportation on the population and communities within the thoroughfare's area. Before the highway was completed in 1923, the transportation link was more diffuse, involving numerous mule trails and various attempts at constructing private toll roads and railways. Thus this thesis begins with a general description of the region's pioneering transportation, and just as the road caused travelers to funnel into a narrow path, this paper then narrows its focus and concentrates on today's Trinity Highway.",Geological Engineering ; Urban ; Transportation Engineering ; Trinity County ; Community and Regional Planning ; Arcata ; Mining Engineering ; Humboldt County ; Highway ; Weaverville ; 299 ; mining,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/speccoll_mono/3

"Recent sediments of Humboldt Bay, Eureka, California","Thompson, Robert Wayne","Humboldt Bay is a coastal lagoon, 14 mi. long and a maximum of 4 mi. wide. The bay has three distinct segments, South, Entrance, and Arcata Bays, each of which occupies the seaward end of one or more stream valleys cut into Plio- Pleistocene paralic sediments. The segments are linked by narrow tidal channels which are bounded by a barrier spit on the west and by high valley interfluves on the east. Climate of the area is rainy temperate . Tides are of the mixed type with a mean range of 6.5 ft.
Textural variations of the surface sediments in South and Arcata Bays correlate generally with bay-floor morphology. Bottoms of the inward branching tidal channels are covered by gravelly, shelly sand which becomes finer and more muddy with increasing distance from t he tidal inlet. Clayey silt predominates on the tidal flats, and highly organic silty clay or clayey peat occurs in the few remaining salt marshes. Tidal flat sediments are olive gray to black and thoroughly stirred by the rich bay infauna. The general pattern of decreasing grain size with increased elevation and distance away from the inlet is controlled by tidal currents. Exceptions to the general pattern and marked textural differences between tidal flat sediments in various of the bay segments result from: direct sediment discharge by entering streams, variable intensi ty of wave action, corrmercial oyster harvesting, and variations in flushing time. Dredged channels have larger components of both gravel and mud than their undredged counterparts.
Study of old maps and aerial photographs coupled with nearly ubiquitous evidence of marsh erosion indicate the bay is in approximate equilibrium, that is, filling at rates the order of 0.2-0.4 cm/yr commensurate with relative sea level rise. Most of the sediment comes indirectly from the Eel and Mad Rivers by way of littoral and tidal currents . Direct measurements show local accretion and erosion rates up to 4 cm/ yr and 11 cm/yr respectively. These fluctuate on a seasonal basis in response to alternating wind-wave patterns and reflect 'in-bay' relocation of materials.
Presence of extensive tidal flats and salt marsh imply former higher rates of accretion and bay infill. The recent change toward equilibrium conditions may relate to sediment removal by dredging and/or to a reduction in sed iment supply caused by northward shift of the Mad River course.",Pacific Ocean -- Humboldt Bay ; Humboldt Bay (Calif.) ; Environmental Sciences ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Oceanography ; Oceanography -- California -- Humboldt Bay ; Geography ; Sedimentation and deposition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/archivepub/12

The History of the Trinity Highway A Study in Transportation Dynamics,"Wilutus, Richard","Although the primary focus of this thesis is a history of California 299--the Trinity Highway, I have studied the construction of that road in the context of the history of transportation between Weaverville and Humboldt Bay. The history of a transportation network is not only a history of connections between people and places but also, in this remote region, the vital link connecting wilderness with civilization.
Ever since the settlement of the Weaverville area in 1848, its residents have sought reliable transportation to Humboldt Bay's seaport and merchandise. During this period a road has connected these two places for less than half that time; only since 1923 has it been possible to travel by road from the sea inland to the seat of Trinity County. Consequently a history of the Trinity Highway must include sufficient background to explain the delay in building this route, despite the acknowledged need for such an artery by the area's residents and both local and state governments. Thus when I refer to the Trinity Highway, I am, in fact , alluding to the more general concept of a transportation link that directly connects the two areas.
This thesis attempts to accomplish the following goals: 1) present a history of the development of transportation within the Humboldt-Trinity cultural and physical landscape; iv 2) analyze the dynamics of route location with an emphasis on the construction of Highway 299; and 3) show and explain the significance of the highway on economic and cultural patterns.
A history of a road connotes a description of the labor, materials, and mechanical construction of the route. While construction techniques and problems are discussed, prefer to study the history of transportation from a more humanistic approach. By determining the needs and desires of the population in relation to actual transportation improvements over time, I can reconstruct and interpret much of the region's cultural and economic history.
While, in a sense, this thesis is a regional history, the study will be limited exclusively to the effects of transportation on the population and communities within the thoroughfare's area. Before the highway was completed in 1923, the transportation link was more diffuse, involving numerous mule trails and various attempts at constructing private toll roads and railways. Thus this thesis begins with a general description of the region's pioneering transportation, and just as the road caused travelers to funnel into a narrow path, this paper then narrows its focus and concentrates on today's Trinity Highway.",Geological Engineering ; Urban ; Transportation Engineering ; Trinity County ; Community and Regional Planning ; Arcata ; Mining Engineering ; Humboldt County ; Highway ; Weaverville ; 299 ; mining,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/speccoll_mono/3

Domingo Santos on Vaissade Road; 8. Nicholson on Mad River Road; 9. unknown on west side of Parton Lane.
Ike said that at the end of World War Il, there were 154 dairies on the Arcata bottom and three creameries: United where Greenview Market it located; Golden State between 8th and 9th streets west of railroad; and a cheese plant Nye-Nissen in built west of present Recycling Center. He said that up to wwn, dairying was as good a job as working in the woods or mill. Twenty cows, two horses, a little tractor would net $1,500 a year. The best dairying period was between 1946 and 1953, but not paying much any more. Ike estimated bottom covered about 5,200 acres.

"Lower Prairie Creek Project Redwood National Park ""Forest Owners""","Van Kirk, Susie","""This file addresses forest ownerships, using deeds, patents, and maps in the Humboldt County Recorder’s Office, Eureka Courthouse. Pretty boring to wade through, these records, nonetheless, document how the public domain of northwestern California—the ancient redwood forests—came to be concentrated in the hands of timber companies. ... Land in the Lower Prairie Creek Project area (plus much, much other forest lands) was obtained through fraudulent patents and deed transactions involving David Evans and his associates for transfer to Scottish investors and eventually to “legitimate” timber companies. The end result, of course, is that what once belonged to indigenous people and then the American public, illegally became the property of private timber companies. Ironically, when the public recognized the urgent need to reserve some portion of these magnificent forests in state parks and a national park, it paid dearly to restore these treasures to public ownership and protection.""",Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Redwood National Park ; Indigenous Studies ; Environmental Sciences ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Lower Prairie Creek ; Humboldt ; History ; United States History ; Natural Resources Management and Policy,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/svk/32

Place Based Learning Community Planning Guide,"Goldenberg, Katlin ; Matthews, Jessica ; Palomera, Raven ; Margell, Steven ; Gorman, Alex ; Sprowles, Amy ; Johnson, Matt","The introduction of Place Based Learning Communities (PBLCs) at HSU in 2015 has become an increasingly discussed topic throughout the university. We use the term “Learning Community” in its strictest sense - a curricular approach to education that intentionally links a cluster of courses around an interdisciplinary theme and enrolls a common cohort of students. The production of higher GPAs and retention and significant achievement gap closure among the HSU PBLC cohorts is undeniable.
All components are comprehensive in the fact that they build a sense of community, belonging, and accountability within the students which serve as factors for higher retention and academic success. Each class, event, study session, field trip, and staff and faculty member are all parts of what make PBLC such a success. There are many components that need to be established and collaborations that need to be formed in order to make student achievement possible. In this manual, you will read what these components and collaborations look like and upon conclusion you will understand what goes into creating a successful Place Based Learning Community.",Educational Methods ; Higher Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reports/1

"Lobstermen, Lobbyists, and Labor Unions Knowledge Gaps and Power in Maine’s Offshore Wind Development","Kashwan, Prakash","Lecture delivered October 14, 2024. Large-scale development of offshore wind (OSW) is a relatively new field with a variety of knowledge gaps about its social and environmental impacts. These knowledge gaps create opportunities for obstructing policy development by entrenched interests. Based on research in Maine and preliminary results of ongoing research in California, Dr. Prakash Kashwan offers lessons for promoting policy development in the presence of competing interests and knowledge gaps. He shows that countering the cynical politics of entrenched opposition demands nimble and adaptive collaborations among actors cutting across the silos of state, society, and markets. He concludes by reflecting on the implications of this research for OSW policy development on the West Coast. Kashwan is an Associate Professor of Environmental Studies at Brandeis University, and the Chair of the Environmental Justice concentration in the Master of Public Policy (MPP) program at the Heller School of Social Policy and Management. A recent article reflecting some of his research findings, “Maine Unions Lead on the Green Energy Transition,” can be read here.

Wiyot History Papers,"Rohde, Jerry","""The Wiyot History Papers are an astonishing and deeply moving set of documents. They contain the only known statements that were both given by and recorded by Indians, probably dictated in the Wiyot language in the early 1920s by several Wiyot elders and translated and transcribed by a younger Wiyot, Warren Brenard. The accounts give great insight into what actually happened to the Humboldt County Indians in the mid-19th century and are testimony to the courage and endurance of a people who for years were under merciless attack.""--Introduction",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wiyot_history_papers/1
