Rhetorical Advocacy and the Scholarship of Application,"Juergensmeyer, Erik","This article argues for an expanded understanding of academic labor as it aligns with Ernest Boyer’s concepts of the scholarship of engagement and the scholarship of application. It draws on theories of rhetorical advocacy and rhetorical ecologies in order to help academics participate more in their communities. It concludes by applying these concepts to a community advocacy project, demonstrating the importance of connecting scholarship and public work.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol1/iss1/7
“It’s Not as Rosy as I’d Like It to Be” A Literacy-and-Identity Case Study of a Contingent Academic (Not) Writing for Publication,"Vacek, Kathleen","For academics hovering between contingent and permanent status, getting publications on the CV can make the difference—or can it? Looking closely at engagement with professional academic literacy practices offers meaningful insights into academic labor. This article considers the case of a newly-minted PhD working a collection of contingent jobs while aspiring to publish and obtain a permanent position. In the face of a heavy teaching load and disheartening job search, Elle Stewart (a pseudonym), decides to put off writing. She disidentifies with the discourse of being an academic and disengages from professional academic literacy practices, despite a life history full of success with academic writing. This case study takes an academic literacies approach and uses a framework of discoursally constructed writer identity to consider how Elle’s literacies and identities mediate one another. While personalizing many of the dilemmas of contingent labor, the case study also considers Elle’s painful disconnection from research and the structural factors that lead her to feel shut out of professional academic writing.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol1/iss1/5

Contingency in Higher Education  Evidence and Explanation,"Shulman, Steven","This paper summarizes recent evidence on the trends in contingency in higher education. Contingent faculty employment, defined as the sum of full-time non-tenure track faculty employment and part-time faculty employment, increased both absolutely and relative to all faculty positions between 2002 and 2015, despite a modest downturn after 2011. The long-term growth of contingency since 2002 has primarily occurred in doctoral degree universities. The short-term decline in contingency since 2011 has primarily occurred in public associates’ degree colleges and in private for-profit colleges. The short-term decline in contingency since 2011 is due to the contraction of the for-profit sector combined with a one-time drop in public associates’ degree colleges. The explanation of the long-term growth of contingency as an inevitable response to financial exigency is rejected. Contingency has increased due to the priorities of higher education administrators, not state budget cuts or other drops in revenue.",Labor Economics ; academic labor markets ; higher education ; Contingent faculty ; adjunct faculty,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol1/iss1/3

"The Praxis of Deceleration Recovery as ""Inner Work, Public Act""","Cortez, Marisol, Ph.D.","Originally published in Deceleration and presented at the 2017 meeting of the Association for the Study of Literature and the Environment, this short essay details the vision and praxis behind an online journal of environmental justice co-edited by the author alongside environmental journalist Gregory Harman. In this essay, I situate the evolution of this project in relation to our precarious institutional positions as writers with disabilities who consequently work in the spaces between academia, journalism, activism, and creative writing. This positionality has in turn placed Deceleration in conversation with degrowth and allied movements around the world, which challenge the disabling productivism that regulates the temporal rhythms of not only academia and everyday life but also our modes of activist resistance. Inspired by these challenges, Deceleration envisions new ways of responding to environmental and political crises, grounding writing, thinking, and acting in a reinhabitation of biological time.",Other Arts and Humanities ; degrowth ; disability ; independent scholarship ; environmental justice ; care ; Environmental Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/7

Rhetorical Listening and Strategic Contemplation as Research Tools Learning from Edwin Hopkins and Early Attempts at Labor Reform in Composition,"Gerdes-McClain, Rebecca","This paper is a personal and historical study of the labor conditions of composition teachers, in which I present the work of Edwin Hopkins, a professor at the University of Kansas from 1889 to 1937, who collected data on composition teaching between 1909 and 1915 in an attempt to reform the labor conditions of composition teachers. The paper is necessarily personal because I employ rhetorical listening, developed by Krista Ratcliffe, and strategic contemplation, developed by Jaqueline Jones Royster and Gesa Kirsch, as research methods for engaging with historical and archival research. Both of these methods require careful analysis of my personal interests in and motivations for this research. This analysis of my personal interests and motivation takes two forms: (1) narrative vignettes of my own labor experiences, which I use to facilitate rhetorical listening, and (2) descriptive analyses of my reactions to my research, which document how strategic contemplation was enacted through my reflective practices. The reader should therefore be prepared for the paper to alternate between readings of Hopkins’ work and reflections on my own teaching and research. Using rhetorical listening and strategic contemplation, I evaluate Hopkins’ strategies for reforming labor conditions in the early twentieth century and what they offer compositionists interested in reforming our current labor conditions. I focus particularly on Hopkins’ attempts to persuade those outside the composition classroom that labor conditions in those classrooms were untenable and directly related the “problem” of unsatisfactory student writing, looking for resonances—my term for connections and similarities—between attempts to reform modern labor issues in the composition classroom and Hopkins’ strategies. Ultimately I argue that attempts at labor reform need to consider historical case studies, like Hopkins', when strategizing ways to improve the teaching conditions of writing instructors. Too often, attempts to improve labor conditions surrounding the teaching of writing ignore the rich and complex labor history of our field.",Composition Labor History ; Rhetoric and Composition ; Feminist Rhetorical Practices,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/4
FAST Professor Strategies for Surviving the Tenure Track,"Droz, Patricia Welsh ; Jacobs, Lorie Stagg","In response to Maggie Berg and Barbara Seeber’s 2016 manifesto on academic deceleration, The Slow Professor, the present article posits that the slow approach is dangerous for those seeking tenure, but is nevertheless a fruitful resistance philosophy to be adopted once tenure is achieved. For those seeking tenure, we advise an alternative philosophy, FAST professing, as a means to mediate workplace stress and offer to those on the tenure-track a pragmatic alternative to premature slow professing. We outline the nature of the stress in today’s academic climate, suggest identifying the major sources of stress, and finally, offer strategies to streamline the workday and maintain life work balance en route to tenure.",slow professor ; professorship ; tenure survival ; workplace stress ; strategies for success ; tenure-track ; Rhetoric and Composition ; academy,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/6
Terms of Time for Composition A Materialist Examination of Contingent Faculty Labor,"Priest, Jesse","Bruce Horner’s seminal book, Terms of Work for Composition: A Materialist Critique provided Comp-Rhet WPAs with a methodology for infusing our conversations about work and labor with a holistic understanding of how these reflect on the lived experiences of students, teachers and administrators. Drawing on empirical data including surveys of contingent faculty at a large northeastern research university, as well as textual analysis of teaching material and an NCTE position statement, I propose the inclusion of a materialist-oriented conceptualization of time to the discussion began by Horner and others. Using the lens of how time is allocated, I argue for a wider understanding of the separations between how institutions and contingent teaching faculty (including graduate teaching assistants) view the importance of their labor, and discuss implications for curricular and departmental design.",Educational Assessment ; labor ; administration ; contingent faculty ; composition ; Higher Education Administration ; Rhetoric and Composition ; Evaluation ; and Research,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/5

"""Collegiality as a Dirty Word? Implementing Collegiality Policies in Institutions of Higher Education""","Wooten, Courtney Adams ; Condis, Megan A","Abstract: Collegiality is integral to the healthy functioning of any academic department and is a necessary professional attribute for new faculty, who often spent their graduate school careers with relatively little involvement in institutional politics, to develop. However, the recent trend to explicitly outline tenure and promotion requirements for collegial behavior gives us pause. We question if a collegiality statement for tenure and promotion could function as yet another obstacle between faculty from background that have historically been underrepresented in the academy (women, people of color, LGBTQ individuals, people with disabilities, etcetera) and their bids for tenure.",academia ; Ethnicity and Post-Colonial Studies ; Gender ; Disability and Equity in Education ; and Sexuality Studies ; labor ; Technical and Professional Writing ; Feminist ; collegiality ; tenure and promotion ; discrimination ; Rhetoric and Composition ; Race,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol2/iss1/3

"Academic Collective Bargaining Status, Process, and Prospects","Julius, Daniel J. ; DiGiovanni, Nicholas, Jr.","The authors provide a perspective, as scholars and practitioners, of the organizational, demographic, legal and contextual variables that inform the past and the future of faculty unions in U.S. colleges and universities. They ask, how best to conceptualize and evaluate the impact of faculty unions; from the inception of academic unionization in the 1960’s to the present, and further, what is known and not known about collective bargaining. Issues examined include: factors that influence negotiation processes, governance, bargaining dynamics, the institutional and demographic factors associated with faculties who vote in unions, compensation and the legal status of graduate student unions. Collective bargaining with faculty is viewed through a wider lens of “craft unionism” as it is known in the industrial labor relations context. An effort is made to review contemporary subjects and challenges engaging the parties during negotiations in the second decade of this century. The paper offers an analysis of the impact of collective bargaining on changes in decision making processes and forums, and offers insight into the kinds of management strategies most effective in organized environments. Last, the authors ask what is new about negotiations and what has remained the same over the past 45 years.",Education ; Unions ; Collective Bargaining ; Labor Relations ; Higher Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/11

(Mis)Alignments Between Institutional Mission Statements and Service Learning Handbooks,"Iglesias, Charisse S","Institutions self-identifying as social justice advocates are expected to perform social justice roles through their disciplines, policies, and actions (Feldman, 2008). Applying Tania Mitchell’s critical service learning framework (2008), this study examines (mis)alignments between service learning handbooks and their respective institutional mission statements. The first phase was a critical discourse analysis of the service learning handbooks to measure expressions of reciprocity. The second phase was a content analysis of the corresponding institutional mission statements to analyze conceptions of community engagement, social justice, etc. Findings reveal how institutions frame handbooks, considers how that framing undermines reciprocity, and analyzes how universities practice what they preach by evaluating perception and performance.

Snapshots of #WPALife Invisible Labor and Writing Program Administration,"McIntyre, Megan","Writing program administration work is a significant reality for many within the field of rhetoric and composition, and though such work has long been part of our disciplinary fabric, it often remains invisible to departments and institutions. In this article, I offer two brief snapshots of how writing program administration work is often obscured by seemingly brief documents or interactions, which elide the complex communicative and political work at the heart of program administration. I then offer a hashtag-based Twitter community, #WPALife, as one potential way of making this work more visible and of building the capacity to create more just, equitable, and anti-racist writing programs. Visibility can’t be an end in and of itself; rather, making this work visible allows me to be a more effective advocate for equitable and anti-racist practices in my program, institution, university system, and discipline.",digital community ; writing program administration ; Twitter ; Other Rhetoric and Composition ; invisible labor,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/8
Sustaining Community-Engaged Projects Making Visible the Invisible Labor of Composition Faculty,"Corey, Jessica Rose ; George, Barbara","Increasingly, service-learning, community-engaged projects, or community-engaged learning are encouraged in higher education as part of HIPs, or High Impact Practices. While the authors' experiences with service-learning or community-engaged learning in our composition courses have been positive, and while student engagement is generally acknowledged as a desirable outcome of any pedagogy, we posit that there are questions about the labor system needed to sustain such practices. We use narratives to reflect upon our experiences holding various identity positions within academia (from graduate student, adjunct, to NTT and TT positions), and research about the work involved with community engaged projects, to interrogate the invisible labor of such projects within composition. By making these labor practices explicit, we can theorize and, just as importantly, practice more equitable and sustainable community-engaged projects in composition.",labor ; community engagement ; service-learning ; community-engaged projects ; Higher Education ; composition ; high impact learning practices ; faculty labor,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/6

Instructional Spending Per Student  Patterns and Explanations,"Shulman, Steven","Most students know what they spend on tuition and other costs of attending college, but most do not know how much their colleges spend on their education in return. This paper provides figures on instructional spending per full-time equivalent student, broken down by institutional level and sector. Variations in this measure of educational spending can be substantial even among apparently similar institutions. A cross-sectional multiple regression model utilizing 2016 IPEDS data on every public and private non-profit college and university in the United States is used to explore the possible causes of these variations. It shows that instructional spending per student rises with the portion of the budget devoted to instruction. It falls with the non-tenure track portion of the instructional staff, with the prevalence of students from low-income backgrounds, and with tuition as a fraction of total revenue. These findings are mostly as expected, but most of the variation in instructional spending per student is still unexplained.",Economics,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/12
Away with the Apprentice Graduate Worker Advocacy Groups and Rhetorical Representation,"Marburger, Zachary B","While graduate workers have a long history of organizing and advocating on their own behalf, concerns specific to their unique identity as both laborers and students have not yet permeated the discourse surrounding worker rights in higher education. Using Edward Schiappa’s work on how definitions are created and circulated, I position that the work and labor of the graduate student is under-discoursed because of the mundane definition of the graduate worker as an apprentice first and foremost. Drawing on the public literature of the Committee on Rights and Compensation (CRC), a current effort to unionize graduate workers underway at the University of Colorado Boulder, I examine the ways in which the CRC is attempting to introduce previously hidden, novel definitions of the graduate worker as a professional first and foremost.",Non-Tenure Track Faculty ; Rhetoric ; University of Colorado Boulder ; rhetoric ; Edward Schiappa ; academic labor ; graduate workers ; collective bargaining ; Other Rhetoric and Composition ; unions ; definitions,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/9
Intergroup Solidarity and Collaboration in Higher Education Organizing and Bargaining in the United States,"Scott, Daniel ; Kezar, Adrianna J","For too long in higher education, different worker groups have conceived of themselves as separated by distinct, even competing interests. The isolation between groups reduces communication, fosters unawareness of common interests, and hinders their ability to effectively collaborate in solidarity, as does the divided and largely independent structure of the unions and bargaining units representing them. Without greater collaboration and solidarity, members of the higher education community are less able to resist the harmful trends that have been transforming the sector over the previous decades, subjecting them to increasingly similar working conditions and distancing higher education from its student learning, community service, and research missions. We propose a combination of elements from anarcho-syndicalist and social justice organizing approaches, centering intergroup solidarity and a flexible commitment to shared missions, as ways for higher education workers to build greater power and have a greater influence on the transformations occurring across higher education.",unions in higher education ; Unions ; Collective Bargaining ; Labor History ; Higher Education ; organizing strategies ; collectivism,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol3/iss1/10

Administrative Rhetorical Mindfulness A Professional Development Framework for Administrators in Higher Education,"Beavers, Melvin E","As part of the post-secondary educational landscape, online programs and courses help institutions reach and enroll more students. To meet the needs of increased enrollments in online education, part-time faculty are often hired to teach online courses. Part-time contingent faculty represent a growing majority across many fields of study in colleges and universities. As Rendahl & Breuch reported, first-year courses, specifically freshman composition, are increasingly taught online. This study uses a mixed-methods design to examine how, and in what ways, writing program administrators (WPAs) approach preparing part-time faculty to teach writing online.

Contingent Faculty Performing Scholarship and Service Examining Academic Labor and Identity at a Public Flagship University,"Wilson, Sarah Bartlett ; Smith, C. Veronica","The faculties of many colleges and universities in the United States are comprised of rising numbers of instructional contingent faculty who are ineligible for tenure. Although these positions generally do not require scholarly or service activities because their primary focus is teaching, the extent to which these faculty members still choose to perform like tenure-line faculty, with at least some kind of balance of teaching, research, and service, is understudied. The current study attempted to address this omission in the literature by collecting data from contingent faculty members at a public flagship university (N = 176) about their engagement with scholarly and service activities. A majority of the respondents (63.1%) had engaged in at least one scholarly activity and in at least one service activity (69.9%). This study adds to our understanding of the lived experiences of contingent faculty and concludes that a majority of these faculty members are, at least in part, building an academic identity based off of traditional expectations and activities for tenure-line faculty.",Academic Identity ; NTT Faculty ; Research ; Academic Labor ; Non-Tenure-Track Faculty ; Scholarship ; Other Education ; Service ; Faculty Performance ; Contingent Faculty,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol5/iss1/10

More specifically, we argue that communication itself (i.e., literally listening, speaking, and writing) becomes emotionally-laden work amid the research, teaching, and service performed by critical women scholars. We aim, through our articulation of communication labor, to disrupt dominant narratives of what faculty work lives should be, and we call for a paradigm shift in the way faculty labor is socially constructed so that we can improve critical women faculty’s success and well-being.",Communication ; faculty work ; communicative labor ; Organizational Communication ; critical scholarship ; gender ; emotional labor,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol5/iss1/3

Emotions in Academic Writing/Care-Work in Academia Notes Towards a Repositioning of Academic Labor in India (& Beyond),"Gupta, Anuj","In this article I seek to reflect on a rupture that happened in my college-level writing classroom in India when a student chose to write about her experience of rape and accompanying life-long trauma in a literacy narrative assignment. This rupture, and the ways in which I struggled to engage with it, were initially discomforting but eventually led to strong convictions about the need to reposition academic writing and labor in Indian universities in a manner that sees the epistemic value of emotions in academic writing and the ethical value of care-work in academia as essential ingredients required to create a socially just world. Both ingredients have the potential to counter the debilitating effects that trauma has on students' abilities to learn and succeed in college, especially for those who are at a higher risk for mental distress due to their marginalized positionalities. Through a thick description of my experiences, I explore the rationale for the call to reposition academic labor; share some practically feasible suggestions which teachers and administrators motivated to work towards social justice can use to experiment in their classrooms; and end by reflecting on the limitations and challenges involved in such experimentation.",Nonfiction ; Reading and Language ; trauma ; writing pedagogy ; literacy narratives ; emotional labour ; Other Rhetoric and Composition ; india,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/alra/vol5/iss1/7

"Recent sediments of Humboldt Bay, Eureka, California","Thompson, Robert Wayne","Humboldt Bay is a coastal lagoon, 14 mi. long and a maximum of 4 mi. wide. The bay has three distinct segments, South, Entrance, and Arcata Bays, each of which occupies the seaward end of one or more stream valleys cut into Plio- Pleistocene paralic sediments. The segments are linked by narrow tidal channels which are bounded by a barrier spit on the west and by high valley interfluves on the east. Climate of the area is rainy temperate . Tides are of the mixed type with a mean range of 6.5 ft.
Textural variations of the surface sediments in South and Arcata Bays correlate generally with bay-floor morphology. Bottoms of the inward branching tidal channels are covered by gravelly, shelly sand which becomes finer and more muddy with increasing distance from t he tidal inlet. Clayey silt predominates on the tidal flats, and highly organic silty clay or clayey peat occurs in the few remaining salt marshes. Tidal flat sediments are olive gray to black and thoroughly stirred by the rich bay infauna. The general pattern of decreasing grain size with increased elevation and distance away from the inlet is controlled by tidal currents. Exceptions to the general pattern and marked textural differences between tidal flat sediments in various of the bay segments result from: direct sediment discharge by entering streams, variable intensi ty of wave action, corrmercial oyster harvesting, and variations in flushing time. Dredged channels have larger components of both gravel and mud than their undredged counterparts.
Study of old maps and aerial photographs coupled with nearly ubiquitous evidence of marsh erosion indicate the bay is in approximate equilibrium, that is, filling at rates the order of 0.2-0.4 cm/yr commensurate with relative sea level rise. Most of the sediment comes indirectly from the Eel and Mad Rivers by way of littoral and tidal currents . Direct measurements show local accretion and erosion rates up to 4 cm/ yr and 11 cm/yr respectively. These fluctuate on a seasonal basis in response to alternating wind-wave patterns and reflect 'in-bay' relocation of materials.
Presence of extensive tidal flats and salt marsh imply former higher rates of accretion and bay infill. The recent change toward equilibrium conditions may relate to sediment removal by dredging and/or to a reduction in sed iment supply caused by northward shift of the Mad River course.",Oceanography ; Environmental Sciences ; Geography ; Pacific Ocean -- Humboldt Bay ; Oceanography -- California -- Humboldt Bay ; Humboldt Bay (Calif.) ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Sedimentation and deposition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/archivepub/12

"The Paiute, Water Wars, and a Covered Up Agricultural Revolution","Chambers, Nicholas Anthony","Like many other Native Americans, the Bishop Paiute in California have long faced an uphill battle in retaining their federally given land rights, access to natural resources, and their ability to remain self-sufficient. Often Native peoples (the Paiute included) have faced a long history of presidential administrations or federal agencies tolerating or even assisting them, only for a small political change to occur and all positive treaties or relations towards them evaporate or turn hostile. Tribes (according to American law) are supposed to be sovereign and see their treaties upheld in perpetuity. However, the Paiute (like many other Native tribes) face different treatment from one generation to the other as American politics (and American views on Natives) shifts so rapidly, as this paper will explore.",History ; United States History ; Native American Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_hist/2
How Biden wants us to think about Ukraine’s conflict,"Shea, Rainer","President Joe Biden’s rhetorical style when talking to the American people about the conflict in Ukraine is one which can be compared to that of President George W. Bush in regards to the perpetrators of the September 11, 2001 attacks. During Biden’s speech about Ukraine in March of 2022, he conveyed an idea parallel to that which Bush conveyed: an enemy of the United States has committed a transgression which can’t go unpunished, and the “free world” needs to fight back at any cost. In order to make this case, Biden used the speech to counter Putin’s arguments for a Russian intervention in Ukraine, invoked memories of the fight against Soviet Russia, and talked about the conflict’s victims. Biden utilized pathos, ethos, and logos to build an argument for a sustained military aid commitment in Ukraine.",Russia ; International Relations ; Ukraine ; conflict ; International relations ; rhetoric,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/1
"Rhetorical Analysis of Choosing to go to the Moon ""and do the Other Things""","Kona, Skyler M","On September 12, 1962, president John F. Kennedy visited Rice University in Houston, Texas, and delivered what is commonly known as one of the most iconic speeches in American history. The speech, titled “Address at Rice University on the Nation's Space Effort”, but more widely known as “We Choose to go to the Moon”, was an attempt to gain further support for the nation's efforts in the Space Race against the Soviet Union. In his speech, Kennedy uses various techniques in order to further boost the audience's understanding of the situation, as well as, crucially, inspiring them to lend their support to these efforts. The speech today is seen as a symbol of victory, given that since then, America has successfully landed the first astronauts on the Moon, but at the time the speech was given, it was difficult to gain public support while the nation was losing the Space Race. This paper is an examination on the rhetoric of the speech, and why it worked well.

The Power of a Podcast,"Donlon, Breanna","This paper examines the correlation between the Your Own Backyard podcast and the rebooting of the Kristin Smart missing persons case. This case had gone cold and seemingly ignored for nearly 25 years, until 2019 when the podcast was created. The host conducted immense amounts of research to try and figure out what happened to Kristin, and in doing so, brought her case back to to the public’s attention. The actions of the podcast host caused the police to become more active on the case again. Because of the podcast, the prime suspect was finally arrested and will be held on trial.
Podcasting has become such a prevalent part of our media intake, with an even bigger impact on us than we might think. Podcasting seems to be becoming a very powerful form of communication. To examine this, we will focus on the history of podcasting, with the intent to show how podcasting can now be considered a form of journalism. Additionally, we will compare printed media with podcast media and how they differ when it comes to bringing awareness to missing persons cases.",Communication ; Journalism ; True Crime ; Podcasting ; Kristin Smart,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/23
Communication Classes That Help With Employment,"Savin, Cole","The reasoning for this paper is to influence you to take communication classes not only for credits or units for your major, but to further your knowledge, skills, and experience as a person. To start off this paper I talk about an interview with a manager about interviews and resumes. Then I talk about all of the communication classes that you can take and how it helps. These communication classes that are mentioned in this paper will help you the most in your employment wherever that may be. This paper will go over what employers look for in you as well as what will help you during employment. I will also talk about 4 skills that you will learn when taking communication classes (problem solving skills, the ability to work in a team setting, communication skills, and adaptability). The Communication classes that will be vital to take are Communication 490, Communication 206 Group communication, Communication 110 public speaking, Communication 120 and 322 intercultural communication, and Communication 324 nonverbal communication. There are many more classes that you can take and all of them will help. The communication department is willing to help you with your future and are very nice.

Shifting A Culture,"Arjomand, Ardeshir J","What is popular culture and how does it influence us? How can we be more critically aware consumers of media messages? Are we always ""online"", or is there some way we can disconnect? These are the questions I've attempted to define through my research and experience studying contemporary ""pop culture"". Consider this a beginner’s guide on how to become aware of and deal with the constant bombardment of media messages, and how to become a filter for content, rather than a sponge. As critical consumers of media we can cater our consumption to better suit our needs and lifestyles. This paper was mainly intended to raise awareness, but also to motivate and inspire us to: disconnect from the noise of society, to get out in nature, and to be positive role models for future generations. I’ve come to the conclusion that you can never fully disconnect, but we can get close if we really try.

Like a Virgin Comparing Cross-Cultural Virginity,"Tejada, Anastasia M","Studies have been conducted about the social construct of virginity inside the United States and cross-culturally. Investigations comparing the United States with these other cultures are limited and focus on the United States as the ideal representation of virginity in men and women. I aim to expand upon the current research provided by adding a new perspective to the analysis. The objective of conducting this analysis is to provide a global perspective defining the connotations of virginity cross-culturally. This study focused on the cultural, religious, and societal impacts on virginity collected through qualitative methods in the cultures of Arab-Americans, Latinx-Americans, and Malawi villages. The concluding evidence supported the theory that although there are specific gender expectations tied to each culture’s version of virginity, in an overarching analysis, the core ideals are too similar to be ignored. Overall, all of the cultures represented in this study viewed women’s virginity as a gift and the women as sexually submissive to men. While male virginity was seen as a failure to men’s masculinity and the men themselves must be a modern day Casanova.",Virginity ; Gender ; Communication ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Intersectionality ; Culture ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Race,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/16
A History Cannabis as a Cultural Communication Artifact,"Harper, Morgan L","This essay aims to detail the mechanics, structure, history, and ideology of cannabis from a socio-cultural perspective within the United States. However, it does contain some content that I believe will correlate with an international perspective. My emphasis in conducting this research is to look at the ways in which cannabis acts as a societal communication artifact, and in doing so, how it has formed a vast and highly identifiable culture. I believe that Cannabis acts as a communication tool both socially and interpersonally, with both notions being equally important to the culture overall. Cannabis has language, looks, and sounds, that come along with it, and these are vital aspects of what makes cannabis a communicative culture. With the recent societal advances in cannabis becoming widely decriminalized and regulated, the cannabis industry is moving from the hills to board room and consumer demographics are broad as ever. I am interested in exploring the ways in which the social and cultural component of cannabis was developed and how this has shifted and evolved, all while staying relatively true to its roots.",Communication ; Artifact ; Subculture ; Culture ; Cannabis ; Socio-Cultural,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/30
Countercultural Representation,"McGriff, Ethan A","Counter cultures have been prevalent throughout modern American history. Accompanied with music, these movements break the barriers of time and live on. Starting with an anecdote, the rapper Lil peep is given as an example of what the movements and music has led up to. To highlight modern movements that lead to that, the flower power movement is given first light. This leads into the punk/ hip-hop era, which gives way for the emocore movement that ultimately defines what our current generation considers to be the counterculture. Movements and music change over time and along the way people get hurt. Essentially music that aligns itself with a movement starts as counter cultural and gains mainstream popularity where it gets sold to death and gives birth to a new genre.",Punk ; Music ; Communication ; Emocore ; Counterculture ; Intercultural Communication ; Flower Power ; Cultural Artifact,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/3
"Children’s Film Media’s Influence on Gender, Race, and Identity","Kovis, Sara M","Whether conscious of it or not, media images have been working our entire lives to construct our attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of the world around us. What is the significance of the relationship between media consumption and how we interact in society? Applying communication theories and research into traditional and digital media is vital in understanding the realities around us. It explains where societal norms and values stimulate and how they trigger new behavioral changes. Ideologies are the mixed concepts and elements that create meaning in society. Today, people's ideological feelings produce pre-dated ideologies rather than their ideas. These are formed unconsciously by other social foundations, like their environment and the media, that surround and shape them. Not only does the media play a significant role in the views of others, but it is also a basis for forming our identities and place in a social context. Enculturation, first coined by anthropologist William Ogburn, is ""the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary to that culture and its worldviews"" (Enculturation, Google Arts & Culture, 2022). Today, enculturation and information about cultures other than one's own are first introduced to children through the media.",Critical and Cultural Studies ; Communication ; Gender ; Worldview's ; Male-gaze ; Cultivation Theory ; Racial Representation ; Communication Technology and New Media ; Symbolic Annihilation ; Gender Norms ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; Children's Media ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Enculturation ; Race,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/31
Stereotyping Gender Roles Children's Commercial Advertisement,"McClelland, Lucky J","Heteronormativity gives the individual in our society a binary optional choice: the first choice being the socially accepted ‘norm’ that follows the heteronormative binary, and the second being the socially disfavored choice of being deemed ‘abnormal’ if one chooses to go against this heteronormative binary. In return, we as a socially constructed society then deem the binary option of the ‘norm’ as the culturally preferred ‘good’ choice, while at the same time deem the other binary option of the ‘abnormal’ as the socially constructed ‘bad’ choice. This occurs both intentionally and unintentionally. The purpose behind my area of focus is to identify that the binary stereotyping of heteronormative gender roles in children’s commercial advertisement is resulting in young children having an essentialized heteronormative embedded ideology. With children’s commercial advertisements exclusively representing the heteronormative non-intersectional gender role narratives, this identity exclusion is leading children to reject any form of intersectional identity that doesn’t fit in the heteronormative binary bracket, as a subordinate socially ostracized form of gender and or sex identity for a child not to follow.",Gender ; Communication ; Intersectionality ; Stereotype ; Heteronormativity ; Advertisement ; Children,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/6
Healthy Environmental Communication Practices,"Magana, Michelle Monique","The goal of my academic research is to highlight the importance of appropriate, scientifically correct and accurate communication when discussing Environmental Health. If we want to begin making changes to help our environment to become more sustainable and ultimately provide more years of existence we must stop the lies, propaganda and spread of misinformation. “Communication constructs a social world that is relational, collaborative, strategic, symbolic, and adaptive” (Learning Outcomes in Communication). The objective is to understand the discourse on environmental issues and try to use our communication discipline to engage and dissect this issue from a Communication perspective. Our standards when talking about environmental issues should be high due to the severity. Recognizing discourse and critically analyzing the messages we are consuming on climate change is important for our own interpretation. As for writers with any type of platform it is our responsibility to create accurate messages for audiences to absorb and make sense of. When communicating about the environment our ethical principles and values should be present. As a society it is very important to practice sharing knowledgeable information to provide truth. Political gain and financial gain should be stopped when compromising our environmental health. We can make a difference if we work to disrupt this discourse and use academia to help save our planet. It is unethical to destroy a whole civilization’s environment for private financial gain. All humans will suffer the consequences of this discourse one day if we do not aim to be accurate and appropriate when communicating about environmental health.",Communication ; communication	 environmental health		 public discourse	 rhetoric 	 media literacy		environmental justice,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/21

"Bisexuality, Intersectionality, and the Bechdel Test in Jane the Virgin","Mallory, Catherine E, Ms.","Abstract
For this project I have looked at the show Jane the Virgin through a critical lens, and analyzed the characters in the show, the stereotypes portrayed about Latino culture, the stereotypes towards bisexuality, how intersectionality is involved, and the Bechdel-Wallace test. Throughout this paper I will examine a few specific characters and look at how stereotypes, of certain kinds, are portrayed, and how others are completely turned on it’s head. I apply terms such as intersectionality, stereotype, and sexuality to the characters and what they go through, throughout the course of the show. I have found that there are a few characters that represent the bi-sexual community, others from the LGBTQIA++ community, and discuss how they are shown positively in the show. I also use a critical cultural lens and look at common stereotypes that are made about the Latino culture, and how this show applies many of them, but also shows characters fighting those stereotypes and proving that not everyone from this culture fits those assumptions.",Communication ; Gender ; Bechdel Test ; Intersectionality ; Telenovela ; Stereotypes,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/20
I’m Not a Tragedy Speaking Up About Ableist Microaggressions,"Colwell, Kasandra Marguerite","Have you heard of ableist microaggressions? Let me tell you about them, as someone who has experienced them. I have a bi-lateral dislocating knee condition that I was born with. I can walk, but sometimes I need additional stability or reduction of pain while getting around, in which case I tend to use a cane. I have had many othering interactions while using a mobility aid in public, whether that be a knee brace, a cane, or crutches. While it often seemed the stranger didn’t mean any harm, the question is how many invasive questions and comments from strangers can one person take? Do they even listen to the response? I notice the different ways I’m treated depending on the visibility or invisibility of my disability. In this paper I will tell stories of some of these interactions during a time when my disability was more visible, and I connect these stories to ableist microaggressions domains and experiences shared in previous research. This paper will take a different route than most academic papers, opting instead for a narrative approach. Considering these are deeply personal experiences, it feels better to tell my story in this way.",microaggressions ; chronic pain ; disability visibility ; Other Mental and Social Health ; Other Theatre and Performance Studies ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication ; mental health ; Disability Studies ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Mental and Social Health ; Critical and Cultural Studies ; ableism ; physical disability ; Liberal Studies ; Creative Writing ; Communication ; Nonfiction ; personal narrative ; Social Psychology and Interaction ; Performance Studies ; Medical Education ; Other Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/27
Challenges Faced by Recently Emancipated Youth,"Peña, Williams ; Butkiewicz, Jerry Walter, III","In this academic research paper, we will be exploring the challenges faced by recently emancipated youth. We chose this topic because of the fact that this is not often spoken about or taught to the general public. This lack of attention to these issues creates hurdles when attempting to solve these sensitive issues. Considering this, we thought it would be a strong choice for further research and review. We explored many obstacles these new adults face. One such issue that we would like to touch on is the unstable housing situation of these recently emancipated individuals. Another prudent example is the issue of healthcare. While some support systems are in place, more should be done in the form of education of these valuable resources available. In layman's terms, foster children have their basic needs covered by the state until the day they turn 18. On their 18th birthday, they are considered adults and can no longer be supported under the foster care system. This is not a system that caters to the success of foster children, this is a system that does the bare minimum. Let's explore how we can do better for foster children and subsequently be better as a society.",Foster Care System ; Communication ; Vulnerable Youth ; Independent Living Programs ; Aging Out ; Foster Youth ; Social Work ; Emancipation ; Health Communication ; Mentorship ; Health Care ; Social Welfare ; Public Affairs ; Homelessness ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication ; Transitional Housing Programs,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/26
The Cost for Our Entertainment,"Younger, Jasmine","Abstract
Sports hold such a dominant role in our society. They provide entertainment for individuals, job opportunities, and have a great impact on any given communities’ economy. However, we as the consumers and fans of the industry, tend to lack further examinations on the dynamics of the economic roles within sports. We sometimes become caught up in the glory of sports and never truly take the time to examine all of the money that goes into the industry. This paper will illustrate the ways in which the sports industry disburses their funds. From the cost of being a fan, to the payments of athletes, and the roles that sports economics play in a professional sports team’s community as a whole. It will then further question whether or not sports are too costly for our own pure enjoyment/entertainment.",Fans ; Communication ; Stadiums ; Economies ; Sports ; Athletes ; COVID-19 ; Finances ; Sports Industry ; Costs,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/4
Parenting in the Public Eye,"Stauff, Sarah","This paper examines how parents share photos, videos and information about their children on social media websites, called sharenting. COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act is mentioned specifically because it does not protect children’s online presence from their parents. Multiple types of sharenting are examined such as; posts for family and friends to view, informational blogs and posts, punishment posts, and YouTube vlogging, or blogging in a video format. Vlogging is dissected by studying three different family vlog YouTube channels and the content that they create. The confidence and sense of self worth of children whose parents participate in sharenting is discussed as well as both present and future repercussions of these posts. Additionally, threats to children’s safety are looked at from how schools, activities and addresses are sometimes available to find on parent’s profiles on websites like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. As well as safety risks, there are often risks of bullying for the child because of the often sensitive nature of these posts. All of these have the potential to be very detrimental to children and their emotional development.

HSU Communicative Practices Administration Must Include the Student Voice,"Medina, Q","This paper examines the impact of communication practices of university administration (openness and inclusion) on the student body’s sense of satisfaction, value, and connectedness by focusing on a selected collection of past moments of communication from administration to students. A total of five current instances where official emails were sent out addressing a handful of the biggest impactful events at the university and the following reactions from the overall student body was used as the qualitative data to analyze the effectiveness of such communication choices. Results of the observations confirmed that the current practices of the university administration were no longer considered wholly acceptable or consistent with the values not only claimed by the university, but also those expressed and attached to the student body identity. More importantly, they showed the clear need for more value and inclusion to be put on student voices regarding big events and decisions made by administrators. The study concludes with the implications of what path the current practices will lead Humboldt State University if not addressed and altered to match the current organizational culture and environment.",Bureaucracy ; Communication ; Administration ; Organizational Communication ; HSU culture ; Organizational communication ; University administration ; Leadership Studies ; Organization Development ; Student voices ; Humboldt State University ; Student culture,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/19
Ripe for Consumption Separating Women from Autonomy,"Stibbard, Nicole Kasandra","This proposed position statement privileges the notion that the male gaze is a damning and damaging force for identifying women in both Western societies as well as within patriarchal societies. This particular exploration is driven by my perceived lack of the true effect that this gaze has socially and intrapersonally over women. The male gaze not only strips women of bodily integrity, bodily autonomy, but autonomy holistically. Beyond the stripping of autonomous worth, the male gaze, i.e. objectification and an autonomous reduction to body parts alone, all result in psychological and physiological damage for identifying women. Previous research in the Communication field focuses on the explicitness of women’s appearances and the drive for objectification and the male gaze to occur; therefore, how and what objectification creates for women’s realities is extremely neglected. In order to properly challenge, and hopefully dismantle: heteropatriarchy, heteropolarity, and heteronormativity which all motivate objectification, women’s reality via the male gaze requires more study to deduce the exact ways in which such objectification could and should be challenged. The aforementioned negative and damaging effects of the male gaze are: belief in rape myths and other anti-women myths relating to violence, bodily surveillance, body monitoring, self-objectification, anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and more. It will require continual autoethnographic accounts from identifying women to gather more of these effects. This form of research and account has the potential to free some anticipation and anxiety surrounding the feelings of isolation which may come from enduring such an oppressive force alone.",Communication ; Heteropatriarchy ; Heteronormativity ; Objectification ; Heteropolarity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/22

Consumerism and Covid - 19  A Neoliberal Analysis,"Roy, Taylor M","This paper attempts to draw a line between consumer culture and COVID -19, while finding how it has been influenced by social media and targeted advertisements. Through exploring Foucault's understanding of neoliberalism and the homoeconomicus, articles and media news, this paper will have assessed the changes of consumer culture due to the “shelter in place” orders. Additionally, it will attempt to redefine Foucaults homoeconomicus to fit this new model as well as observe how electronic surveillance through social media platforms and their targeted ads will or have changed the landscape of neoliberalism. In summarizing the notable differences in the use of individuals' online presence versus the older model of focus groups we will see that society is providing immeasurable numbers of free labor hours. By analysing all of these different avenues, this paper will attempt to create predictions for what this “new” neoliberalism will look like not only for the current climate but what this will imply for the neoliberal climate of the future - that is the world we will be living in when things go back to “normal”.

"Mankind, Humans, Congressman It’s All Inclusive, Right Guys?","Thacker, Rachael","This paper takes a look at research surrounding the use of gendered language and how it impacts occupations and careers from ages as young as grade school, and all the way into adulthood. The use of gender-fair language creates a more gender inclusive attitude towards traditionally male occupations. The masculine generic language used in our culture perpetuates gender stereotypes among children as young as six and continues on into adulthood. Changing the language to include both women and men allows for both to self-identify beyond the stereotypical occupations and see themselves as successful. This can be seen in how children view occupations as gendered, in whether or not women apply for job advertisements that use masculine generic language, and even in the job itself when the job relies on students evaluating a teacher’s performance. Self-identification is important in regards to success, and language plays a role in this. Even gender-fair language is not fully inclusive as it reinforces the binary and causes erasure in marginalized groups such as the trans community or someone who identifies as nonbinary. Language is a powerful tool to uphold current power structures and make privileged bodies hyper visible.",Binary ; Gender ; Communication ; Masculine generic language ; Gender-fair language ; Work ; Occupation ; Normative language ; Stereotypes,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/15
"Non-Verbal Communication, Anxiety, Behavioral Changes within Covid Regulatory Changes","Stack, Sydney ; McCracken, Olivia","In the current era of education and social communication shifting into a virtual world the students entering the early elementary education system have experienced something that is new to all of us. Within the last two and a half years life as we have known it has vastly shifted. Virtual learning and communication, which is not something that is new, but something that was scarce prior to the Covid-19 pandemic is now the “new normal.” For many of the students affected, this way of learning has shaped much of their educational career. Changes like these are affecting areas of development within these young students; such as the development of their nonverbal communication, the increase of anxiety, alongside behavioral shifts. Throughout this paper we will be discussing and analyzing the current research and data alongside these new protocols, as well as their effects in the short term on those who are most vulnerable. Some of the new protocols and overall changes that we will be looking into are the use of masking, social distancing, distance learning, and the increase in screen time. Above all, the questions we are going to be looking at are: Have these changes affected early elementary students, and has it created limitations within their nonverbal communication, and increasing anxiety?

The media is defined as television, movies, advertisements, etc. Women have been represented as being oversimplified through their stereotypical portrayal as housewives and mothers in the media, alongside being hypersexualized through their clothing and body image. Both of these forms of portrayals have had negative effects on women. Young girls are now being targeted as well through the explicit tones that the advertising of children’s toys creates. This paper aims to demonstrate how women have been disadvantaged through their stereotypical portrayal in the media and the ways in which that has led to their rights being disregarded in society. The overturning of the legal case Roe v. Wade is a prime example used in this paper to demonstrate a direct way in which women have been disadvantaged and the ways that their portrayals in the media may have led to this. This paper also aims to convince society that changes must be made to the ways that we show women in the media.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/33

Interpersonal Communication From Student to Host Family,"Magee, Tajma R","This research project aims to improve interpersonal communication between international students and their host families. Existing research and data shows that students can have a difficult time adjusting to their life abroad, whether it be within their host home or within the institution they are studying at. This can greatly affect their overall studying abroad experience and can affect the way they communicate with the members of their host family. Factors like the student’s academic performance in school and behavior in school may be affected as well. Identifying the issues that contribute to a negative experience in a host family’s home will provide study abroad programs, institutions connected with study abroad programs, host families and the international students themselves with the tools they need that are necessary to improve the overall communication within a host family and international student home. I will collect data from students in the California State University system studying abroad in three different locations: Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. I will also present a proposed questionnaire that would need to get approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if I actually went through with this plan, I will include the link to the website to get that done below. My initial research showed that these are the most popular study abroad destinations among college students in California. I will dig in deep to track and identify the positive and negative elements of the study abroad experience that affect the behavior and communication between the international students and their host family. I will look into the students that returned from the program as well. This method will provide a deeper, more personable understanding of what aspects of the program, from the student’s perspective, and can be improved to increase the communication between these two parties. This collection of data, with recommendations, will be given to the California State University system, the international programs, and the participating host families in hopes of improving the quality of the travel abroad experience for international CSU students, and more specifically the communication they have with their host family.",Communication ; Sojourner ; Organizational Competence ; Pragmatic Competence ; Schema Theory ; Imagined Community,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/28

A Critical Analysis of Mobile Interpersonal Relationships through Uncertainty Reduction Theory,"Kee, Rachael L","Through the use of online dating apps, individuals are having the chance to begin, develop, and end interpersonal relationships without ever even meeting the partner in person. It is assumed that this is happening due to the lack of primary tension in initial contact, as uncertainty reduction can take place from behind a screen. This study sought to connect the theories between Uncertainty Reduction Theory and mobile interpersonal relationships. The axioms of Charles Berger’s theory come into play during online dating as the eight key variables of relationship development are utilized in most successful interpersonal relationships to further intimacy, in an attempt to reduce primary tension. To further connect, four information-seeking strategies can be utilized during the online dating experience as people have the ability to observe online interaction, seek information from a third party online source, talk directly to the person of interest, and browse the internet for information about them as well. Through these primary connections between URT and mobile interpersonal relationships, areas of interest for further research can be actions towards comparing those who reduce uncertainty in an online platform versus those who do in-person in a longitudinal study.",Communication ; Primary tension ; Mobile ; Online-dating ; Uncertainty reduction theory ; Interpersonal relationships,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/32
Group Involvement Cohesion & Tensions through Collaboration,"Hernandez, Edwin","The importance of teamwork and group involvement is essential not only in school to complete a common goal, but employers need to know that you have cooperation skills and the ability to collaborate with others in a diverse setting effectively. As my roommates and I arrived from different parts of California into a rural small county called Humboldt, we all came for the environment, but perhaps for distinctively altered reasons. We looked to develop improved relationships as well as group communication within the confines of our living space. Additionally, the goal was to maintain and manage a clean environment within our dorm room. For some of us, it's the first time living alone without our parents, however, we don't have them to clean up after ourselves anymore. Even though we each have our separate rooms, sharing and cleaning the kitchen, as well as the bathrooms, have already created certain tensions within our group.
The purpose of this research is to investigate how individuals within the collegiate academic level form relationships amongst their roommates. We are all different in our personal characteristics, however, the end goal is to maintain and manage a clean environment. With each passing day, we learn more from each other whether it’s flaws, skills, or strengths. We, in a sense, are forced to live with each other. Getting to know my roommates has been interesting. Each person is different and unique in their way. To co-exist in tranquility and create a safe space, we need to understand the importance of roles. We all need each other to do task chores because it will make for a suitable environment.

Pink Is The New Tax,"Burns, Eliana","Historically women in America have made colossal advances that have proven they are just as capable as men. Women had fought and continued to challenge the system since 1919 with the 19th Amendment giving them a right to vote. However, even with this crucial progression, womens’ oppression can be found all around us only in much more subtle ways such as “ the pink tax”. As of 2020 there are currently no federal laws to outlaw companies from charging different prices depending on which gender they are meant to be marketed to. This rhetorical analysis will first address the concept of gendered products, how the tax benefits from these products, and why gendering of products reinforce gender discrimination and stereotypes. A brief explanation as to why the tax is nicknamed “the tampon tax” is included. Next the economic effects of the tax especially in terms of over the course of an average lifetime.

This paper seeks to acknowledge and critique the inherent failings present in the neoliberal system of healthcare adopted by the United States. By identifying and criticizing components of insurance, employment, and the fetishization of marketplace competition, I will make a Foucauldian analysis of the flawed power structures existing within a privatized health system. The goal of this article is to articulate and make clear the case for the implementation of a single-payer system in the United States, which would see a much vaster and more equitable breadth of positive health outcomes. New language will be introduced such as the idea of health outcomes and health justice. Both concepts encompass principles and values that should exist within a progressive healthcare system functioning within the borders of the wealthiest country in world history. The extent to which COVID-19 exposes what this paper considers to be inherent shortcomings and expected failures within the healthcare system is used as further evidence to encourage the reconstruction of the US healthcare system into that of a single payer infrastructure.",Critical and Cultural Studies ; Communication ; Foucauldian ; Health Justice ; Markets ; Un-insurance ; Single-Payer ; Health Communication ; Healthcare ; Subaltern ; State of Exception ; Neoliberalism,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/13

"Data Capitalism, Digital Health, and Marxism","Stanger, Samantha C","Abstract
When immersed in a capitalist society individuals often fail to see the ways in which they are exploited, and when these discussions do come into discourse they are often geared toward workplace labor. Less commonly do we consider the ways in which these problems arise in conjunction with free labor, mainly performed in digital spaces. While less often considered or discussed, the exploitation occurring in the digital world is real and has substantial consequences, particularly when the digital spaces involve sensitive information and data.  This paper aims to address how data capitalism functions in three different digital health spaces: online patient forums and support groups, mental health apps, and direct-to-consumer DNA sequencing companies. In order to show how patients are persuaded to join and contribute to these digital spaces there will be an investigation of the rhetorical strategies utilized in marketing tactics. We will consider the economic functioning of data capitalism through a basic Marxist perspective, which criticized the capitalist mode of production and exploitation of workers, or in this case the creators of data.",Communication ; capitalism ; marketing ; Direct-to-consumer genome sequencing ; free labor ; rhetoric,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/25
Dissecting Ideologies Embedded in Ford Advertisement,"Afsarzadeh, Sidney Rain Shabnam","The goal of this paper is to exemplify rhetorical criticism to examine an artifact. Specifically, this paper will use the method of ideological criticism to identify ideologies embedded in a commercial. In the case of this paper, the commercial being examined is a Ford truck commercial titled, Ford for the Builders, Built for America. This paper will identify and explain the ideologies used to advertise Ford trucks. It is important to be able to identify ideologies embedded in things like commercials in order to not be blind to cultivation theory. Which is a theory created by Professor George Gerber in the 1960s. Overall, the goal is to identify messages which are communicated through advertisement. Ford is one of the original American businesses and every person in this country who has been around television and or the internet has seen their ads. This paper will identify the meanings they are trying to portray with their ads. Along with why they would choose to communicate those ideologies in their advertisement. When a person is able to identify ideologies being portrayed by someone or something else they can be less affected by them. Moreover, this paper may teach a reader how to embed meaning into their own rhetoric by comprehending the dissecting of rhetoric.",Communication ; Ideological Criticism ; Ford ; Cultivation Theory,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/29
Representation in Animation,"Benoit, Michelle L","In this paper I’m addressing what is missing in representation in films today. I take the shows Avatar: The Last Airbender, Steven Universe and Fairy Tail to explain what proper representation should look like in the media. I look at this with the perspective of rhetoric as a communication major. Providing my comment on the shows. I’m examining this show with three factors. Do they have women in roles of leadership? Are characters overcoming adversity? Are there male characters experiencing complex emotions? I’m comparing these shows with most western films. That would usually tell stories through the white cisgendered straight male. I take examples from each show to how these characters are a step in the direction of proper representation. The paper addresses characters such as, Steven, Garnet, Pearl, Lapis, Rose and Greg in Steven Universe. Aang, Katara, Zuko, Iroh, Teo, Katara and Toph in Avatar: The Last Airbender.

"Treatment Plan and Educational Guide for Removing Invasive Barnyard Grass, Canada Thistle, and Cocklebur within the Baduwa't (Mad River) Estuary","Turner, Ashley S ; Lallman, Alex D","Our project is located at the Baduwa’t Estuary. We partnered with CalTrout to assist them with meeting one of the objectives for their Mad River (Baduwa’t) Estuary Floodplain Habitat and Public Access Enhancement Project. CalTrout partnered with the landowner, McKinleyville Community Services District, to restore 4.25 acres of the estuary. Our project focused on reducing the abundance of invasive plant species within the estuary area. The target plant species were barnyard grass, Canada thistle, and cocklebur. First, we conducted a literature review to learn the best management practices for eradicating the three target species. Then we conducted a field survey to locate all individuals of each plant on the project site. At each location, we recorded the proximity to water, the extent of each patch of barnyard grass and Canada thistle (not cocklebur because they occurred only as single plants), and described the soil and terrain. Next, we developed a treatment plan for the eradication of barnyard grass, Canada thistle, and cocklebur based on the data we gathered through our research and field survey, as well as stipulations set by the landowner. We suggested hand removal and an annual return to retreat before each species flowers. Hand removal methods were outlined as a step-by-step process for future volunteers assisting CalTrout. Lastly, we conducted a volunteer event to evaluate our removal methods for Canada thistle.",Environmental Monitoring ; Sustainability ; Steelhead ; Invasive plants ; Environmental Sciences ; Coho ; Barnyard grass ; Mad River ; Canada thistle ; Baduwa't ; Salmonids ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Plant Sciences ; Chinook ; Cocklebur,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/1

These two sites are located within the Eel River (Wiya’t) estuary, roughly 10 miles west of the city of Fortuna, CA. This study was conducted during the months of September through October 2023. Data collection was done through seine net dragging at randomly selected sample points across both sites. Seine net hauls were recorded by species and species count, which were later computed using a diversity index to provide values representative of diversity for each haul. When testing for a significant difference in diversity between the two sites, a T-test was used to determine that there was in fact no significant difference in the fish assemblage data that was collected at the unrestored site and the restored site (p-value",Environmental Monitoring ; Estuary ; Population Biology ; River ; Cannibal Island ; Aquaculture and Fisheries ; Fish ; Eel River ; Eel ; Ocean Ranch Unit ; Fish Assemblage ; Salt Marsh ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Assemblage,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/2
"Cultural and Ecological Restoration of School Creek at Blue Lake Rancheria, Humboldt County, CA","French, Cecilia C ; Mendoza, Michelle ; Galindo, Roots ; O'Neil, August","The School Creek Cultural Revegetation and Riparian Restoration Project site is a low elevation riparian forest surrounding the seasonal creek channel approximately a mile from its confluence with the Baduwa’t (Mad River). The site was originally restored in 2021, with recontouring of the channel and revegetation, however mortality occurred for many planted species which prompted this 2023 project. The School Creek site has been severely degraded over the last hundred years from land use practices, industrialization, and colonization. Streams that have been damaged by heavy logging have created high sedimentation levels within the Baduwa’t, which is listed as “impaired” on the U.S Environmental Protection Agency’s 303(d) list for excessive siltation/sedimentation and temperature (State of CA North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, 2018). Additionally, the industrialization of the town of Blue Lake has altered the natural course of the School Creek channel and landscape by building a school, railroad grade, mill, and housing. The forcible separation of the Wiyot people from their ancestral land halted native management practices, further pushing the degradation of the watershed. The lower Baduwa’t riparian area was converted to pasture for grazing sheep and cows. However, since 1983, Blue Lake Rancheria has worked to buy land back in the watershed and restore it (Wiyot Tribe, 2023). This project is on Blue Lake Rancheria land, and seeks to restore the riparian area by utilizing native and culturally significant plants which have been cultivated for specific purposes since time immemorial by the Wiyot people. Revegetation of culturally significant plants will allow for both cultural and ecological resilience, enhancement of biodiversity, and reinforcement of ecosystem services.",Tek ; Baduwua't ; Sschool Creek ; Blue Lake Rancheria ; Stream ; Mad River ; Riparian ; Revegetation ; Restoration ; Channel,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/3
"Analysis of Benthic Macroinvertebrate Response to Restoration Flows and Scour in the Trinity River, Northern California","Gutierrez, Sarah ; Avina, Julie","This study investigates the ecological impact of restoration flows and scouring events on benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities within the Trinity River, an ecosystem historically impacted by anthropogenic activities. Central to this study is the examination of how hydrologic alterations, especially the construction of the Lewiston Dam, have influenced these vital ecological indicators. Using data collected earlier in 2023 from a current study by Benjamin King, we analyzed BMI samples from three river sites (Junction City, Pear Tree, and Lorenz Gulch), both prior to and following a major scouring event in January 2023. This paper utilizes statistical analyses, including ANOVA and t-tests, to assess changes in BMI biomass and species diversity. Notably, the results demonstrate a significant reduction in BMI biomass post-scour, with a significant shift in the community composition towards species more beneficial as salmonid prey. These findings highlight the ecological shifts occurring in response to managed river restoration efforts and stress the importance of considering BMI dynamics in river restoration management. This study contributes valuable insights into riverine ecosystem responses to environmental management strategies, offering an understanding of the impacts on aquatic biodiversity.",Natural Resources Management and Policy ; Environmental Monitoring ; River ; Water Resource Management ; Water ; Scour ; Macroinvertebrates ; Scouring ; Environmental Indicators and Impact Assessment ; Invertebrates ; Restoration,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/4
"Sampling Lepidopter Moth Diversity across Different Treatment Plots at the Ocean Ranch Unit in the Eel River Wildlife Area, Humboldt County, California","Kragness, Cory M ; Montiel, Madison S ; Budke, Victoria C ; Chapman, Ryanne N","Coastal dune ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest are known to be highly complex, dynamic, and are relatively vulnerable to climatic changes (Madurapperuma, B, et al. 2020). There are many evolving factors that have the potential to influence the coastal dune ecosystem ecology. For example, disturbance from noxious non-native species, anthropogenic factors, fire, and climatic changes are known to affect the stability of active coastal dune systems (DaSilva, M et al. 2021). The widespread colonization of European beachgrass (Ammophila arenaria) is a specific disrupter of coastal dune ecology as introduced non-native species and has decreased biodiversity of flora and fauna at the Ocean Ranch Unit in the Eel River Wildlife Area (Ocean Ranch Restoration Project Final EIR, 2021). An estimated 40 to 60 percent of the coastal dune system has been covered by Ammophila arenaria since its introduction to Humboldt County in the 1970’s (Ocean Ranch Restoration Project Final EIR, 2021). In restoration of the coastal dune system, the Ocean Ranch Restoration Project has employed a variety of eradication strategies including prescribed burning, herbicide application, manual removal, mechanical removal, or a combination of methods (Ocean Ranch Restoration Project Final EIR, 2021). However, evaluating the recolonization of biological communities is important in monitoring the success of these treatments. Lepidoptera are newly emerging as an effective indicator species of ecosystem health due to their population relationship to successional stages of ecosystem development (Dar, A. A. & Jamal, K. 2021). In support of monitoring the reestablishing coastal dune communities, this study examines the Lepidopteran abundance and diversity through sampling of moth assemblages in the treatment plots of the Ocean Ranch Restoration Project (ORRP).",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/5
Coastal Prairie Enhancement Recommendations for the Baduwa’t Estuary Overlook,"Corcoran, Kelly ; Acosta, Gabe ; Bacon, Parker","The incorporation of native plants into the Baduwa’t Estuary overlook encourages the practice of preserving local tribal resources and promotes the valuable ecosystem services provided by the estuary’s bluff. The recent restoration and trail development of the Baduwa’t Estuary public access area highlighted the importance of collaboration with the Wiyot Tribe for incorporating culturally significant plants into the site. Wiyot tribal input should be utilized going forward in preserving cultural environmental resources and enhancing the native coastal prairie biodiversity of the site. An objective of this project is to create recommendations for the site's further development in collaboration with the Wiyot tribe. To create a preliminary recommendation planting plan in the form of a map and written recommendations for the land managers, the McKinleyville Community Services District, and CalTrout the project proponent for the Baduwa’t Estuary Restoration and Public Access project. Our project aims to add to the management of the public access area with a recommended planting plan map to guide future landscaping. Vegetative data was collected during a site inventory analysis (SIA) using the quadrat method along a 300 meter transect tape. Species Diversity and Abundance was calculated through total percent cover and analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index. The UZT produced a species diversity of 2.88 (Table 1), the MZT produced a species diversity of 2.14 (Table 2), and the EZT produced a species diversity of 1.78 (Table 3). Based on the composition of the seed mixes that were spread during site restoration by CalTrout in 2022, we determined the vegetative composition of survivorship from the seed mix and how the herbaceous cover might support coastal prairie enhancement through additional select plantings. Our recommended use of both seeding and direct transplanting of select native coastal prairie flora aims to support cultural and environmental resources.",Native plant communities ; Humboldt County ; Culturally significant plants ; Coastal prairie ; Vegetation management ; River overlook ; Mad River ; Baduwa't ; Public access ; Beautification,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/6
Rending the Social Fabric Vigilante Strikebreaking in 1930s California,"Claybrook, Abigail Ivie","During the 1930s, employers across the United States organized against the National Labor Relations Board and the renewed labor movement. These employers utilized several different strikebreaking techniques, including vigilante violence. California, an economic powerhouse with an established history of vigilantism, produced a particularly robust antilabor network. A cluster of corporations and employer associations formed connections with local vigilante organizations, and mobilized them against workers during periods of labor unrest.
Secondary sources on vigilantism in 1930s California tend to focus on antilabor violence in Central and Southern California. However, the strikebreaking techniques and vigilantism typically associated with these regions carried over to Northern California as well, highlighting the sheer effectiveness of the state's antilabor network. The pervasive nature of this network meant that antilabor violence was an omnipresent threat, hazarding the labor movement and dealing a blow to the greater social fabric.
This paper provides an overview of antilabor violence in California. The latter half of the paper surveys episodes of antilabor violence in Northern California specifically, with an emphasis on towns typically omitted from secondary sources.",Vigilante ; California ; Associated Farmers ; Labor History ; Strikebreaking ; Vigilantism ; Northern California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/16
Intercultural and International Communication in the Surrogacy Industry,"Baker, Jessica","Understanding the relationship between intercultural communication, international communication, and the proper way to discuss sensitive topics (infertility, surrogacy, LGBTQ+) in the surrogacy industry leads to strong communication. When communicating internationally or interculturally, there may be challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and cultural taboos. In order to avoid uncomfortable situations or miscommunication, knowing how to change the way we communicate with Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) is a necessity to navigate important conversations. In the surrogacy industry, knowing how to communicate interculturally and being culturally competent about sensitive topics such as infertility or loss can determine the success of a surrogacy journey and change a client's life hopefully positively. To show respect and support for others, it is important to approach these topics carefully and with knowledge. When discussing sensitive topics interculturally, the way we communicate changes from our dialog, vocabulary, tone, and approach. By consciously being aware of the changes that must be made, trust can be built when discussing sensitive topics and by showing someone your support, avoiding miscommunication, or misunderstandings due to differences in culture, sensitive topics can be better communicated interculturally.",Intercultural Communication ; Women's Studies ; LGBTQ+ ; and Transgender Studies ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Surrogacy ; Gender ; Gay ; Cultural Competence ; Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) ; Critical and Cultural Studies ; Bisexual ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; Race ; International Communication ; Lesbian ; Health Communication ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/15

Assessing Career Planning Courses without using test scores another neglected issue?,"Holmes, Alison, PhD ; Collins, Loren, MA","Twenty years ago, in an article entitled “Assigning Grades in Career Planning Courses: A Neglected issue”[1], Rex Filer posed several important questions in terms of the practicalities of how we design and grade career planning courses. The challenge, he suggested, is that while teaching pedagogy often relies on Bloom’s traditional taxonomy where information and understanding act as an ‘anchor’ while synthesis and evaluation are goals achieved later, career course activities are naturally geared to the top of the pyramid – regardless of when the class is taught. This, he argues, poses particular issues in terms of career course objectives and outcomes.
Even a cursory examination of the literature on career course assessment may offer some insight as to why Filer’s individual instructor/student level concerns have been ‘neglected’: most of the mainstream work in this area is based on various types of exams or pre and post test scores. One of the most common tools, the Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI) based on Cognitive Information Processing Theory, helps researchers determine ‘dysfunctional thinking’ in career problems and identify issues for specific populations as well as general ‘progress’ made in the course.
While such tools are invaluable and have provided many crucial insights in terms of the value and impact of career courses, the suggestion here is that, for smaller schools and programs, there is a largely unmet need to discuss grading systems used for career courses and the assessment of career education at any given institution.
This paper will examine the course design and assessment process, including specific rubrics and tools, used by an interdisciplinary program at our small liberal arts school in a remote, rural California campus of Humboldt State University (HSU). The goal, with Filer, will be to address (another) neglected issue of how we go about creating career development interventions, design specific courses, and assess career education at the level of the individual student, instructor/course and program.

Career Planning and Curriculum Integration millennials on the ‘lost’ coast,"Holmes, Alison, PhD ; Collins, Loren, MA","Career preparation during college is increasingly an area of interest and concern not only for the parents, family and friends of prospective students, but administrators, politicians, and even the average taxpayer. As costs continue to rise, the ‘value’ of higher education is no longer based primarily on the goal of preparing a future generation to participate in, and to lead a democratic civil society, but on how competitive students will be in the global marketplace as a result. Humboldt State University is located approximately 300 miles north of San Francisco in a relatively isolated region known as the ‘lost coast’, famous for old growth redwoods and a dramatic coastline. Over the past five years, HSU has started to take seriously the challenge of connecting the ideals of a relatively small, liberal arts school to the changing goals and aspirations of an increasingly diverse student body in the context of an ever more connected world.
This paper seeks to do two things. First, to briefly outline current questions in the field of career development with a view to better understanding how the stated goals of the millennial generation affect their ideas of ‘career’ and ‘success’. Second, to offer Humboldt State University as a case study by examining the way these issues have influenced the development of career education in the HSU’s College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences (CAHSS), specifically the International Studies Program.
The argument is that while the overarching goals of millennials are not so very unusual or different from their predecessors, career education needs to adapt to meet specific needs of our students. Further, that this is best done through a strategy that combines traditional ‘user activated’ services, with intentional ‘scaffolding’ designed by each college – ideally by each department or program. The objective is to offer other and/or similar institutions a framework that includes a range of approaches to embedding career education into the academic curriculum in a way that not only meets the range of needs of our students, but also connects the liberal arts education campus to the classroom of the world.",Career Readiness Courses ; Arts and Humanities ; Career Development ; Millennial Students ; Liberal Arts ; Career Aspirations ; Under Represented Groups ; Curriculum ; Curriculum and Instruction ; Higher Education ; Career Planning ; Professional Development ; International and Area Studies ; Minority Students ; Career Curriculum,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/careercurriculumconnections/2

"The Chanterelle The Magazine of Environmental Studies at Cal Poly Humboldt, 2023-2024",,"The Chanterelle showcases the written work of Environmental Studies majors at Cal Poly Humboldt. Each contributing author enrolled in “ENST 395W: Research & Analysis for Environmental Studies” during the 2023-2024 academic year. While each student chose their own topic, they were prompted to write for a public audience. Specifically, they were encouraged to write for a friend, co-worker, roommate, sibling, or any other family member. Our intended audience in this magazine is thus public. We hope you enjoy this collective project.

How Biden wants us to think about Ukraine’s conflict,"Shea, Rainer","President Joe Biden’s rhetorical style when talking to the American people about the conflict in Ukraine is one which can be compared to that of President George W. Bush in regards to the perpetrators of the September 11, 2001 attacks. During Biden’s speech about Ukraine in March of 2022, he conveyed an idea parallel to that which Bush conveyed: an enemy of the United States has committed a transgression which can’t go unpunished, and the “free world” needs to fight back at any cost. In order to make this case, Biden used the speech to counter Putin’s arguments for a Russian intervention in Ukraine, invoked memories of the fight against Soviet Russia, and talked about the conflict’s victims. Biden utilized pathos, ethos, and logos to build an argument for a sustained military aid commitment in Ukraine.",Russia ; International Relations ; Ukraine ; conflict ; International relations ; rhetoric,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/1
"Rhetorical Analysis of Choosing to go to the Moon ""and do the Other Things""","Kona, Skyler M","On September 12, 1962, president John F. Kennedy visited Rice University in Houston, Texas, and delivered what is commonly known as one of the most iconic speeches in American history. The speech, titled “Address at Rice University on the Nation's Space Effort”, but more widely known as “We Choose to go to the Moon”, was an attempt to gain further support for the nation's efforts in the Space Race against the Soviet Union. In his speech, Kennedy uses various techniques in order to further boost the audience's understanding of the situation, as well as, crucially, inspiring them to lend their support to these efforts. The speech today is seen as a symbol of victory, given that since then, America has successfully landed the first astronauts on the Moon, but at the time the speech was given, it was difficult to gain public support while the nation was losing the Space Race. This paper is an examination on the rhetoric of the speech, and why it worked well.

Kendrick Lamar and the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show A Neo-Aristotelian Analysis,"Ashby, Nova","Rhetorical analysis is a form of criticism that has a goal of examining and explaining the relationship between a text, the author of that text, and the audience the text is being presented to. It allows for a deep dive into understanding the author's choices and intentions, whether that be informing, entertaining, or persuading, and how those things affect the audience. While written texts and verbal speeches are most often looked at for this type of analysis, other forms of communication can be analyzed as well such as songs, advertisements, films, and even social media posts. In that context, this essay will be examining the 2025 superbowl halftime show performance by Kendrick Lamar.  It will explain who Kendrick Lamar is, his accomplishments, why he was chosen for a rhetorical analysis, and the analysis itself. It will dive deeper into the meaning and significance of his performance and that performance will be interpreted using the Neo-Aristotelian approach. It will discuss why Lamar chose specific songs, lyrics, and signs to represent himself and his message, and it will further dive into what his message really was and the meaning behind his choices. Also being discussed is the results of his performance, both good and bad, and how it was received. At the end of this paper, it will briefly describe two other rhetorics that could be used to analyse Lamar’s halftime performance.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/6
Rhetoric and Gender Equality in Emma Watson's HeForShe Speech,"Ancheta, Alexa","This paper looks at Emma Watson's 2014 HeForShe speech at the United Nations and how she used different speaking techniques to promote gender equality. As a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, Watson used her fame to encourage both men and women to support feminism. The paper breaks down how Watson made her message clear using the Five Canons of Rhetoric, including how she organized her speech, used language, and connected with her audience. It also discusses how she used credibility, emotion, and logic to persuade people. The paper explores how Watson’s speech encouraged men, especially younger ones, to care about gender equality, and it looks at both the positive reactions and the criticisms she faced. In the end, her speech helped change how people think about feminism and called for men and women to work together for equality.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/7
A Rhetorical analysis of Allyson Felix’s commencement speech at USC in 2022.,"Solares, Silvia","This paper looks at Allyson Felix’s 2022 commencement speech at the University of Southern California using the neo-Aristotelian method. Felix is a USC graduate and Olympic track star. During this commencement speech she shared her personal story about finding her voice and standing up for what she believes in. She was a very successful track and field athlete with many sponsors. She found her voice especially when it came to speaking out about pregnancy discrimination in sports. She explained clearly and with much detail how her experience with Nike led her to push for policy changes that now help other female athletes. She also created her own company with the values and standards she expects for herself.. This analysis breaks down her speech by looking at how she built credibility, connected emotionally, and organized her message to inspire graduates. Felix’s message about using your voice, even when it ‘shakes’, knowing when to create change and when to seek it and living a life with purpose was powerful and personal. Her speech was not only meaningful for the students listening that day but also important in showing how one person’s actions can make a big difference.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/8
A Moonshot in an Uncertain Time,"Brown, Griffin Thomas","This is a rhetorical analysis of John F. Kennedy’s speech at Rice University given on September 12th, 1962. This speech was chosen because of its cultural and temporal significance, and it has been analyzed in a myriad of ways according to the surrounding texts within the COMM 300 framework. The paper contains a synopsis of the rhetorical situation at the time, as well as an analysis of the speech using the 5 canons, symbolic convergence theory, and visual perspectives. Kennedy’s speech is deconstructed, and his juxtaposition of pride and careful optimism is studied intently below. In addition, Kennedy’s argument surrounding difficulty being an innate motivator and his calls for the American people to unite as one are looked at through the historical context they fall under as well as the societal ideals they seek to undermine.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/9
"President Eisenhower’s Farewell Address, Is Hindsight 20/20?","Winslow, Max Seldon","While less famous than MLK's “I have a dream” speech or George Bush's “Axis of evil” speech, Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address stands as an equally important part of American speech history. Eisenhower’s farewell address holds great significance in terms of 20th-century American political development, from its direct appeal to the people in regard to the all-but prophetic prediction of the rise of the military industrial complex, to its standing as a “Last Hurrah” of small government traditional American conservatism. The United States may have changed entirely, yet Eisenhower’s farewell address stands in time as an unheeded warning to the American people, one that is as relevant now in 2025 as it was in 1961. In this paper, I intend to dive into Eisenhower’s farewell speech, examining it with a neo-Aristotelian lens. In the following paragraphs, I will describe the rhetorical situation faced by Eisenhower in 1961, interpret Eisenhower’s farewell address according to the 5 canons, and evaluate the overall lasting implications of his speech. Lastly, I shall discuss 2 additional rhetorical considerations in terms of how they apply to this speech, those being: The narrative paradigm and fidelity of his speech.",Eisenhower ; Communication ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Address ; Discourse ; Rhetorical ; Speech ; Analysis,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/10

Los méritos de Alexander von Humboldt para la climatología mundial y para la forestación,"Holl, Frank","Alexander von Humboldt fue uno de los climatólogos más destacados del siglo XIX. El presente artículo trata sobre sus estudios climáticos y muestra el impacto que estos tuvieron en muchos países del mundo. La primera publicación fundamental sobre los efectos climáticos de los bosques la realizó Humboldt en 1809 en su Ensayo político sobre Nueva España. Numerosas medidas de forestación se iniciaron en el siglo XIX gracias a sus estudios. Pero Humboldt detectó algo más: fue el primero que habló de “grandes masas de vapor y gas en los centros de la industria” que afectan el clima. Sin embargo, él no podía prever las amenazas de un cambio climático antropogénico tal y como lo afrontamos hoy. Pero especialmente en México y Estados Unidos, sus estudios sirvieron de referencia clave para iniciativas de forestación. Sus hallazgos con referencia al impacto climático de los bosques, no obstante, cayeron en el olvido en el siglo XX. El hilo roto de la recepción de las investigaciones de Humboldt sobre el clima se reanudó con el movimiento ecologista en la década de 1970 y Alexander von Humboldt fue reevaluado como climatólogo y primer ecólogo moderno.",Technology ; sostenibilidad ; History of Science ; ecología ; and Medicine ; forestación ; cambio climático ; Humboldt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/1
"Humboldt, el ruso – Humboldt, the American","Lubrich, Oliver","Durante mucho tiempo, Alexander von Humboldt fue percibido ante todo en relación con América Latina. A partir de la edición de sus escritos completos (2019, 2021), también podemos seguir su publicación y recepción internacional en inglés y en ruso. Durante su vida, 250 de sus artículos aparecieron en inglés y 40 en ruso. Las experiencias de Humboldt en Estados Unidos y en Rusia fueron contradictorias. En Estados Unidos encontró condiciones favorables para la comunicación de sus ideas políticas. En Rusia, viajó en condiciones difíciles de vigilancia y censura.

Alexander von Humboldt en España. Los antecedentes necesarios del viaje americano.,"Puig-Samper, Miguel Angel","Uno de los aspectos más desconocidos del viaje americano de Alejandro de Humboldt es el de su paso por España, sobre todo su trabajo científico, sus contactos y los medios de preparación de la exploración del Nuevo Mundo en compañía del botánico y médico francés Aimé Bonpland. Humboldt tenía varios motivos para tomar la decisión de viajar a España, aunque el fundamental fue el fracaso de sus planes anteriores para viajar a otros lugares del mundo. Necesitaba el permiso del rey Carlos IV para investigar en las regiones que le interesaban. Conseguir este permiso no era un asunto fácil, ya que el gobierno de España había mantenido la política de no dejar entrar extranjeros en sus colonias, al menos de una manera tan privada. En parte debido a la capacidad diplomática que tenía Humboldt, pero en mayor medida por los contactos indicados que mantuvo con personas influyentes, fue lo que hizo posible que Humboldt consiguiera el permiso necesario para la realización de su proyecto americano. nivelaciones barométricas y se ofrece el perfil topográfico peninsular. De alguna manera el viaje por España se puede considerar como el viaje preparatorio, planeado para el proyecto americano, ya que realizaron el tipo de investigaciones con las que querían iniciar sus labores también en América. Esto tiene que ser considerado como una hazaña científica porque este tipo de investigaciones apenas se podían apoyar en trabajos hechos anteriormente. Finalmente, hay que reconocer la aportación notable que hicieron Humboldt y Bonpland para la investigación naturalista de España.",Technology ; History of Science ; Latin American History ; European History ; and Medicine ; Intellectual History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/3
Encuentro feliz Benjamin Vicuna Mackenna y Alexander von Humboldt,"Brintrup Hertling, Lilianet","Benjamín Vicuña MacKenna y Alexander von Humboldt. El intenso deseo del joven chileno de 24 años, Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna (1831-1886), escritor, periodista, historiador, político y viajero, de encontrarse con el famoso científico prusiano Alexander von Humboldt en Berlín en 1855, lo lleva a describir con singular detalle este encuentro breve y cruzado. La superioridad del científico europeo es expresada en un tono de sólida admiración. Admiración que no era mutua, porque von Humboldt no podía admirar a quien aún no había ni estudiado ni escrito, y el científico prusiano ya había viajado y realizado su tarea en el Continente Americano. Un viajero tan singular como Vicuña Mackenna se las arregla para que en su narración quede testimonio de cómo un chileno puede llegar a tener, no sólo un encuentro, sino una conversación tȇte-a-tȇte con dicho científico altamente célebre. La inminencia del encuentro mismo, eclipsa el total aburrimiento que Vicuña Mackenna experimentaba en Berlín. Dejar por escrito ese ‘momento huidizo del encuentro único’ era importante, pues era el modo de quedar registrado para siempre en la historia de los viajes y de las ciencias en Chile y de su desempeño posterior como figura pública; y de paso les recordaba a sus lectores, que él era parte de una “filiación de ruta cultural y científica” y que no era un improvisado. El encuentro ‘feliz’ con von Humboldt hace que Vicuña Mackenna llegue a Berlín siendo uno y regrese a Chile siendo otro, ya educado y formado.",Viajes ; Alexander von Humboldt ; Literatura ; Benjamin Vicuna Mackenna ; Siglo XIX ; Spanish Literature,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/4
El encuentro de Alexander von Humboldt  y Enrique Gil en Berlín,"Carrera, Valentín","La celebración del X Congreso Internacional e Interdisciplinario Alexander Von Humboldt en la ciudad de León propició la mejor ocasión para hilvanar ante distinguidos colegas especialistas en la materia uno de los hilos más desconocidos de Humboldt: su relación con el poeta y diplomático Enrique Gil, Padre de las Letras Leonesas. Esta contribución hilvana, pues, sobre el telar del Romanticismo, los cabos sueltos del encuentro en Berlín de dos inteligencias deslumbrantes, dos personalidades de alto voltaje literario y humano, que compartían su homosexualidad y sus vínculos con logias masónicas. La relación, descrita como amistad íntima, se extendió desde septiembre de 1844 a febrero de 1846.

Paisaje de Cataluña y Valencia. Polimatía y epistemología en el sello epistolar de Alexander von Humboldt en concordancia con las observaciones de Antonio José Cavanilles,"Garcia, Martha","Epistolary activity dates to Ancient Greece in affinity with the Roman tradition in which the missive was the most efficient means of communication at a distance. An erudite knowledge of the subject was required since the content would be recorded in posterity. Polymathy and epistemology were therefore required in daily practice of writing encyclicals from the society of Medieval era up to the pinnacle of the epistolary genre during Humanism. The letter, therefore, implied the fact that the writer was out from the territory of the point of departure and the recipient of the correspondence was distant. This exegesis focuses on the textual legacy of Alexander von Humboldt, who, given his wisdom as a naturalist and humanist, sketches in the letter sent to Kurl Ludwig Willdenow as a literary portrait the vivid illustration of the ecological contour of the Catalan and Valencian regions. The narrative images printed also on Cavanilles’ observations and on Humboldt’s cartography are in dialogue—in the form of a travel chronicle— with the pictorial works La sierra de las Agujas and Paisaje de Cataluña, respectively. The methodology applied consists of the analysis of the textuality of Cavanilles’ observations and Humboldt’s epistolary that focuses on the protagonism of nature in the historical distance of time and space. To this end, careful attention has been dedicated to the rhetorical premise of narratio inscribed in Humboldt’s letter, which converges graphically with the landscape of Catalonia and Valencia due to his travels made on the European continent and throughout Spain.",Fine Arts ; Modern Languages ; Narratio ; Rhetoric and Composition ; Humboldt ; Rhetoric ; Retórica ; Epistemología ; Textualidad ; Viajes (10 words) ; Art Practice ; Classics ; Arts and Humanities ; Arte ; Cavanilles ; Spanish and Portuguese Language and Literature ; España ; Polimatía ; Reading and Language ; Spanish Literature,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/6
Los mapas gráficos multi-dato de los viajes científicos de Humboldt como precedente  de los modernos sistemas socio-ecológicos,"Muñiz Martínez, Norberto","Este artículo analiza el papel visionario de Alexander von Humboldt como científico geógrafo que sentó las bases de la integración de los análisis geográfico-ecológicos y los humano-sociales. Humboldt fue precursor de la interdisciplinaridad científica, integrando la observación científico-empírica basada en la recogida de datos, con un subjetivismo compatible con el sentimiento hacia la naturaleza y los seres vivos. Humboldt aunó metodológicamente ese enfoque dual en análisis gráficos que captaban las complejidades derivadas de los sistemas complejos y emergentes, donde el todo en su conjunto es más que la suma de partes fragmentadas. Su visión combinaba análisis de ámbito local y global, sentando los precedentes teórico-conceptuales de los sistemas socio-ecológicos holísticamente considerados. Inspirándose en el gráfico bio-geográfico del NaturGemälde de Humboldt y su interpretación multivariable, este trabajo ofrece una revisión de mapas conceptuales de sistemas socio-naturales. Finalmente se aporta una investigación propia, relativa al análisis de la labor de la ONG African Parks de protección y estabilización de la fauna africana amenazada, en un ámbito local -el parque nacional de Zakouma (Chad) y en un ámbito internacional en todo el continente africano, creando una red de dos decenas de espacios protegidos.",Social and Behavioral Sciences ; complex socio-ecological systems ; Life Sciences ; Humboldt pioneering interdisciplinarity ; mapping human and nature interactions ; armonious sustainable value co-creation,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/7
Alexander Von Humboldt rescate patrimonial y escritos para una memoria de justicia social latinoamericana,"Ilarregui, Gladys","Un códice, una estatuilla en piedra, un dibujo estelar en un papel plegado, el ocre y el rojo ladrillo decorando figuras extrañas. Un grupo familiar en una ceremonia, mujeres con glosas que salen de la boca, rostros con orejeras, el humo de los tiempos. Estas cosas agujereadas, maltratadas por la humedad y muchas veces rotas han soportado ya varios siglos, pero el coleccionismo europeo de la Ilustración las revisa, selecciona e interpreta. Desde la modernidad que Byung- Chul-Han describe como el momento de las “no-cosas”, cuando las cosas que estabilizaban la vida humana y le daban continuidad pierden su efecto sobrecargadas de información y sin nostalgias, el interés de Alexander von Humboldt por los documentos mesoamericanos, nos da una idea de su infatigable reconocimiento por las culturas prehispánicas y el esfuerzo por decodificar sus significados. Se sabe que principios del siglo XIX, von Humboldt dio a conocer la existencia del Códice Vaticano A (Codex Vatic. Lat. 3788) conservado en la Biblioteca Apostólica Vaticana, además de su ya conocido aporte con la impresión de las láminas del Códice Dresden.

The Astrobiological figure of Humboldt as pioneer in the rock varnish research,"Jordan-Soria, Jose","From Humboldt is particularly interesting -and little know- his description of mineral coatings on rocks 200 years ago, reported in his book Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent during the years 1799-1804, co-written with Aimé Bonpland, for which is considerate the father of rock coating research. On June 5th 1799 set sail from A Coruña -Spain- to Cumaná -Venezuela- beginning five years of expedition. While they explored the Orinoco River system, in th eriver basin waterfalls, Humboldt observed the presence of dark coating depositions. He ascertained a manganese-rich accretion, reporting similar structures in other places. Nowadays, these types of geochemical coatings are called rock varnish -or desert varnish in arid environments- in scientific literature. Composed by clay minerals -Si, Al- cemented on a bedrock with variable manganese [Mn]-iron[Fe]oxides and trace elements in it smatrix, only has been studied in detail just during the last decades, achieving an accurate chemical and microbiological description. These structures have great geomicroecological interest because (i) it has a high oxidative power, (ii) gather polyextreme conditions, (iii) stressful conditions, (iv) host microorganisms of biotechnological interest and (v) can preserve interesting biomarkers embedded in its matrix. In fact, interesting rock varnish-like structures have been observed in Mars where appreciable amounts of manganese have been detected by Chem-Cam onboard Curiosity rover. Therefore, the study of rock varnishes, which legacy was initiated by Humboldt, can be considered as another terrestrial analogue and to be explored much deeper.",Evolution ; Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology ; Other Microbiology ; Geochemistry ; Other Life Sciences ; Other Earth Sciences ; Biogeochemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/9

La España de José Martí,"Hernández, Laura A.","Después de sufrir en Cuba una terrible condena a trabajos forzados, acusado de atentar contra la corona española, José Martí consigue que le sea concedido el destierro a España. Llega a Cádiz cuando inicia el año de 1871, y España se encuentra bajo el breve reinado de Amadeo de Saboya, quien ha sustituido a Isabel II después de ser obligada a abdicar, pero que será derrocado en 1873 por un gobierno republicano. Martí dejará España a fines de 1874 para reencontrase con su familia en México, cuando los borbones han recuperado el poder y preparan el ascenso al trono de Alfonso XII. No parece aventurado, entonces, afirmar que Martí vive uno de los momentos más importantes de la historia de España -la patria de sus padres-, donde se formará como universitario y adoptará ideales de la filosofía krausista, que es la base en que se funda la ideología republicana. Y si bien esta efervescencia liberal la comparte Martí con entusiasmo, el hecho de que los liberales no se planteen conceder la independencia a Cuba -temerosos de sucumbir ante unas arcas vacías-, lo obliga a enfrentarse con ellos a través de artículos periodísticos, donde señala con firmeza la incongruencia que representa que una república sea colonialista.

Los primeros viajes decisivos de Fernando Arrabal entre España y Francia,"Tallgren, Viveca","The first journeys of the writer and dramatist Fernando Arrabal between his home country Spain and France were decisive for both his life and his extensive literary production. Arrabal grew up in Franco’s Spain. His father was a Republican lieutenant and was sentenced to imprisonment for life because of his denying to participate in Franco’s rebellion against the democratic Republic. Arrabal’s mother was, however, a supporter of Franco. This political clash between Arrabal’s parents affected him strongly. During his adolescence it became difficult for him to endure the cultural climate in Franco’s Spain. At the age of 22 he hitchhiked to Paris to see Brecht’s Mutter Courage and got fascinated by the liberal atmosphere in Paris. He succeeded in getting a scholarship to the city in 1954.

"De Vente a Alemania, Pepe a ¿Te has venido a Alemania, Pepe? aspectos económicos y culturales de la emigración en dos generaciones distintas","López Fernández, Daniel","En Vente a Alemania, Pepe, el epónimo protagonista decide seguir el camino de muchos de sus compatriotas y abandonar temporalmente España con la intención de ganar más dinero en el extranjero, una esperanza que se ve pronto frustrada. Décadas más tarde, la crisis económica que comenzó en 2008 parece haber dado lugar a una repetición de este capítulo tragicómico de la historia española. No obstante, existen diferencias notables entre ambas generaciones. La migración actual atañe a una generación muy distinta de la que se marchó en los años sesenta y setenta. Se trata, en muchos casos, de inmigrantes con una formación alta y un nivel cultural medio, con conocimientos de idiomas notablemente mejores y con un perfil más internacional y europeo. Para dar constancia del perfil y de las subjetividades de estos nuevos emigrantes españoles, la universidad y el ayuntamiento de Rastisbona en Baviera publicaron en 2015 la colección ¿Te has venido a Alemania, Pepe? En ella se evidenciaban, por una parte, las dificultades surgidas de una economía neoliberal que profundiza las desigualdades sociales, así como la necesidad que tienen los emigrantes españoles de contar esta precariedad, de narrar la experiencia de lo vivido. Por otra parte, los relatos de la colección muestran también la mayor predisposición de esta nueva generación de emigrantes a aceptar, en el marco de un mundo globalizado, las diferencias culturales del extranjero y a adaptarlas como propias, sin por ello dejar atrás el acervo cultural español.","Visual Studies ; German Literature ; landismo ; Ratisbona. ; ""Vente a Alemania ; crisis económica ; Pepe"" ; españolada ; ""¿Te has venido a Alemania ; European History ; Pepe?"". migración ; glocalización ; Spanish Literature",DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/two/6

Imagined Communities in the Orient Mapping New Definitions of Moroccan Spatiality through Western Travelogues,"El Bakkali, Abdelaaziz","The portrayal of Morocco as an exotic location has often been related to the tradition of European Orientalism. From Daniel Defoe to Edith Wharton, the Western presence in Morocco has long been identified by means of several encounters, which has become a central attempt to identify and analyze the country as Oriental. Many of these encounters have resulted in diverse representations that have primarily framed Western ideas about the Oriental world. Morocco, which was identified as an international itinerary of early travelogues about North Africa, has long been a place of Western cultural anthropology and ethnographic surveys. In addressing new definitions of Morocco’s locales, this paper aims to show how the issue of spatiality is discussed through an Orientalist framework. Further, it introduces various narratives that have long stood as cultural and political discursive means. The paper tries to disclose the American nostalgic inclination towards a new age of empire, in which Morocco is imagined as a convenient apposite strategic setting to possess and meet specific ideological interests in the Arab world. To elaborate on the construction of new definitions of spatiality, this paper discloses insights about the following questions: How has Western identity been constructed through de-territorializing European and American ideals? How have some Moroccan locales been turned into international contact zones? This paper delves into these issues by positing a cultural studies approach, relying mainly on qualitative content analysis to rethink alternative possibilities of other perceptions.",Other Arts and Humanities ; Spatiality ; Orientalism ; Mapping ; Identity ; Representation.,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/two/8
Antes de Cook el descubrimiento español de Hawái. Nuevas perspectivas,"Cuevas Góngora, David","La historiografía más ortodoxa otorga el galardón del descubrimiento de las Hawái al capitán James Cook al frente del Resolution y el Discovery el 18 de enero de 1778 durante su tercer viaje. La noticia del hallazgo sembró las dudas y los desacuerdos; pues cómo era posible descubrir islas en esas latitudes sí los españoles llevaban surcando esas aguas más de 200 años entre exploraciones y la ruta de los galeones de Acapulco-Manila y viceversa; abierta desde 1565. Además de que la cartografía antigua señalaba islas con topónimos hispanos a lo largo del Pacífico Norte y, concretamente, en la misma ubicación en la que Cook avistó las islas que él denominó de Sándwich, pero su longitud no era la correcta. A raíz de estas presunciones sobre que esas islas ya las conocían los españoles, se generó un intenso debate historiográfico y elaboración de teorías desde el siglo XVIII al XX; algunas serán rebatidas, otras acotadas al terreno de la conjetura con escasos fundamentos y otras totalmente rechazadas. En este trabajo trazaremos una línea y análisis de las diversas teorías que fueron surgiendo para conocer sus orígenes y alcance; dejando para el final una nueva teoría con aportes inéditos relacionados con el intento de tornaviaje realizado en 1543 por el San Juan de Letrán de la escuadra de Villalobos para alcanzar Nueva España desde las Filipinas.

José Mariano Mociño (1757-1820) Heroic Botanist/Physician of New and Old Spain,"Janota Wasik, Thomas Milan","José Mariano Mociño traveled extensively in New Spain and helped to collect and classify thousands of plants according to modern scientific protocols. In addition, Mociño made significant contributions to science in geology, ethnology, epidemiology, ornithology and horticulture. He was in the vanguard of the study of native Mexican medicinal plants and played a crucial role in the control of infectious disease in the colony and the mother country. Although a contemporary of Alexander von Humboldt, the two never met. Nonetheless, the Prussian traveler was well aware of the accomplishments of Mociño. In his Ensayo politico sobre el Reino de la Nueva España Humboldt wrote “El señor Mociño, who we have already named as one of the compañeros of señor Sessé, and who carried out difficult excursions from the Kingdom of Guatemala to the Northwest coast of Vancouver… [occupied] a very distinguished place among the wise men [of Mexico].” The Mexican born scientist was named the co-leader of the Royal Spanish Botanic Expedition to New Spain (1787-1803) and was instrumental in its inventory of the flora and fauna of the colony. Unfortunately, political turmoil in the mother country prevented publication of its discoveries.

"Humboldt Holding Up Duane Flatmo Says Goodbye to ‘El Pulpo Mecanico’ and Looks Back on His Life as a Muralist, Kinetic Sculpture Racer and Celebrity Elbow Rubber","Flatmo, Duane ; McGeary, Stephanie ; Goff, Andrew","""Sending your child off into the scary world when they reach the age of maturity brings with it mixed emotions. Oh, they grow up so fast, don’t they? Sure, you’re excited for them to go out and test their independent selves but it’s natural to worry, even when your offspring is a giant, flaming metal octopus. Did I raise them well enough to burn the world down out there without me?
Such were the feelings experienced recently by Humboldt’s most famous artist Duane Flatmo. After a decade blazing his way into the hearts of fans of his El Pulpo Mecanico art car — a period that included many trips to Burning Man and various festivals — Duane inked a lucrative deal that a few weeks back sent his most-celebrated creation from its birthplace in Eureka to its new permanent home in Austin, Texas where it will flame on under new management.
“It’s very bittersweet watching this go because it’s pretty much the pinnacle of what I’ve ever built in my life as an artist,” Flatmo told the Outpost as he loaded the machine on a pair of flatbed trucks for the last time. “I got paid well which for it which allows me now to carry on and make something else.”
On this week’s edition of Humboldt Holding Up — LoCO’s Zoom-aided, lo-fi pandemic-era podcast attempt — Flatmo opens up about saying adios to his fiery eight-armed baby and discusses how its success changed his life. Topics on this week’s podcast include:   The life and times of El Pulpo Mecanico Duane’s beginnings as a Humboldt County sign painter Finding success as a muralist and kinetic sculpture racer Celebrities Duane has managed to brush up against How his guitar “style” has landed him on national television on multiple occasions More!

Humboldt Holding Up Let’s Talk Psychedelics! Arcata City Councilmember Sarah Schaefer on the Council’s Recent Decriminalization of Entheogens,"Goff, Andrew ; McGeary, Stephanie ; Schaefer, Sarah","""
You’ve probably heard by now that the Arcata City Council recently passed a resolution decriminalizing the use of psychedelic plants and fungi (if you haven’t, read about it here), an item that was brought forward by advocacy group Decriminalize Nature Humboldt with support from City Councilmember Sarah Schaefer.
“I think it’s a really important ideological stand against the war on drugs and against the fact that we vilify any drug and anybody who uses them since the 1970s,” Councilmember Schaefer told the Outpost. “Plants — like psilocybin, like mescaline, like ayahuasca — have been used in traditional ceremonies, for religious purposes, as rights of passage for cultural events for societies for millenia. And so it just doesn’t make sense that these plants and fungi would be illegal and would be such the center of controversy.”
On this week’s episode of Humboldt Holding Up — the Outpost’s lo-fi, but high-potency podcast — Schaefer dives deeper into her reasons for supporting this resolution, her appreciation for the history and uses of psychedelics and how she hopes this can help the people in her town seek alternative options to improve their mental health and well-being.
Of course, the councilmember cares about a lot of other issues and touches on other topics, including:   The City of Arcata’s plans for $4.4 million in ARPA funds  Establishing a safe parking program in Arcata to help the homeless Housing needs and plans for development of Arcata’s “Gateway District” What it’s been like to enter city council during the pandemic Her early local fame winning the Oyster Festival’s oyster calling contest at age seven""",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/covid/134

She ultimately obtained her degree, but it was her unwavering desire to work on boats in Humboldt Bay that led her to the role she enjoys now.
“I went down to the marina here at Woodley Island and just kind of hung out on the docks bugging random fishermen, asking for work,” Tonning told the Outpost. “I got laughed at a lot.”
On this week’s episode of Humboldt Holding Up, LoCO’s good enough podcast, we trace the story of how Tonning earned the attention of ubiquitous local mariner Leroy Zerlang — who would go on to bestow her with her more well-known moniker, “Captain Zippo” — to obtaining her captain’s license at age 27, to eventually going on to helm the MV Madaket, Humboldt’s beloved historic pleasure cruiser.

For Linda Cooley, Yurok tribal member and Mad River’s new CEO, the acquisition has been a dream, as its led to her seeing her people represented in spaces where they’ve historically been invisible.

However, Papa and Barkley grow, distribute, and sell a product. They are also one of the only businesses that provide products nationwide. They are a good business to look back on because they are paving the way for federal legalization, and their role during the pandemic is making it possible. The Cannabis industry is labeled as an essential business during the pandemic, which is a feat. Michael Kraft describes their responsibilities as an essential business and the safety protocols they impose on the employees. Kraft also explains the change in sales and service as the pandemic started and continued over the months leading up to the interview. It is informative from the perspective of distribution management and in sales minus the retail aspect. They have an online retail presence, which is important because the pandemic has moved many resources online so the fact that Cannabis has an online presence makes it more accessible. This research can not only contribute to the research of the economy during the pandemic, but it can also contribute to the history of the Cannabis industry. The United States is on track towards federalizing it legally, and if that happens, it can help explain why it was legalized and its benefits for the future.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/covid/15

Toward Automated Thesis Classification Open-Sourced AI Foundations for Libraries,"Rowe, Courtney","University libraries often face challenges in making student research more accessible. Manual tagging of theses is time-consuming, while commercial AI tools can be costly and limit institutional control. This project, in collaboration with the Cal Poly Humboldt Press and the TIDE computing cluster, fine-tuned an open-source AI model, ModernBERT, to automatically classify theses using the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The model performed well, demonstrating a promising, cost-effective approach for libraries to enhance research discoverability while retaining ownership and flexibility.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest2025/35
"The Isolation and DNA Extraction of Phytophthora from Four Wildland Soil Types in Northern California, Humboldt County","Lasko, Angelina ; Lee, Christopher ; Baston, David S. ; Marshall, Susan E.","Phytophthora species are of global importance (Sinclair and Lyon, 2005). For most Phytophthora species, the natural mechanism of how these pathogens travel and spread long distances is not fully understood. They are have been shown to travel by air, water, nursery stock, and via inadvertent human transport. The purpose of this study was to identify the presence of Phytophthora species in four different Northern California forest/wildland soil types. Soils from Franciscan complex parent material (riparian, mixed conifer, and oak woodland), and serpentine parent material (mixed conifer) were sampled in Humboldt County (Fig 1). Phytophthora and other pathogens were baited from each soil type with Rhododendron leaf disc (Fichtner et al. 2007, Reed lab) and Port Orford-cedar baits. To select for Phytophthora sp. we cultured baits on clarified VS agar containing PARPNH (Reed Lab) with follow up isolation on a modified layer Ampicillin plate method to eliminate bacterial contamination. Large hyphal quantities were cultured in a clarified VS broth, rinsed, and freeze-dried. DNA was extracted using either a NaOH method (Osmundson et al. 2012) or the Plant DNeasy kit to compare results. DNA was amplified using PCR with ITS (internal transcribed spacer) primer pairs ITS 5-4 (Ristaino et al. 1997), ITS 6-4 (Ristaino et al. 1997), and Phytol-4 (Davidson et al. 2003). Purified PCR products from both extraction methods were submitted for sequencing. Initial results point to Phytophthora species including P. cambivora and P. undulata. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/creative_pub/1004/thumbnail.jpg",Forest Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/creative_pub/5

"From Adjustment to Transformation Applying an Evidence-Based Figure-8 Model to Guide Students Through Transformation Before, During, and After Study Abroad","Ross, Susan L. ; House-Peters, Lily A. ; Holmes, Alison R","The 23-campus California State University (CSU) system has an excellent record of sending students abroad and remains a champion of this high impact practice. Despite system-wide policies and Executive Orders that include requirements to promote pre-departure information sessions and support for returning students - gaps remain. This research argues that the popular models of culture adjustment no longer adequately frame the processes that students experience before, during, and after transformative (and potentially traumatic) study abroad. This is particularly the case for BIPOC, First Gen, undocumented/DACA, URM, and LGBTQ+ students who are increasingly represented in study abroad cohorts. The authors therefore applied the ‘Figure-8 Model of a Complete Transformation’ to three CSU study abroad related courses.
This article is an initial report of a two-part project. The first part involved a survey of study abroad coordinators across the CSU to discover current practices. The second part implemented versions of Ross’s Transformation Curriculum with students in Spring 2023. Students from CSU Long Beach used this approach during a faculty-led semester-long program in Costa Rica, while students at Cal Poly Humboldt were offered several tools before and after their study abroad as part of courses required in the International Studies degree program. These preliminary results strongly suggest that we can and must change our approach to study abroad curriculum to better support our shifting student populations.",Medicine and Health Sciences ; study abroad ; culture shock ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; transformation vs adjustment ; diversity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/csuglobalaction/vol2/iss1/1
"Six Steps to a Successful Study Abroad Program Case Study in Stockholm, Sweden","Burton, Bryan R","This article is meant to serve as a guide for developing a short-term (typically 2 to 3 weeks long) faculty-led study abroad program. I will focus solely on my work in Stockholm, Sweden during summer 2023. This article will be particularly helpful to faculty members who are new to developing their own study abroad programs. I have six suggested steps for developing a successful faculty-led program. These six steps include:   
thinking about what you want for students and your own career;   
building on-campus partnerships;   
Recruiting and supporting students as early as possible;   
making the program itinerary interactive and rewarding for your students;   
preparing students for international travel;   
reflecting at the conclusion of the program while continuing to build long-term relationships with global partners.",Arts and Humanities ; Education ; Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Sweden ; Criminology ; Study Abroad,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/csuglobalaction/vol2/iss1/2
Changing Perspectives in California A Transformative Culture Exchange for Stockholm University and Sonoma State University Criminology Students,"Burton, Bryan ; Hellmer, Sofie ; Wåhlmark, Vida ; Ortiz, Hope ; Grant, Diana","From June 13 to 20, 2024, Sonoma State University (SSU) hosted 16 criminology students from Stockholm University (SU) for an educational and cultural exchange. Five SSU undergraduate “student ambassadors” participated, representing California and SSU while assisting the Swedish students. Surveys indicated the exchange was a meaningful academic and cultural experience for all participants. The Swedish students deepened their understanding of the U.S. criminal justice system through presentations by criminologists and discussions with practitioners on issues such as policing and prison reform. They also gained broader perspectives on California and the United States through interactions with SSU ambassadors and visits to historical and cultural sites such as Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge. The SSU ambassadors, some of whom had never left the West Coast, developed international perspectives by engaging with peers from abroad and expressed increased interest in studying overseas. The program was designed to be affordable for Swedish students, with university housing provided and transportation arranged for off-campus visits; SSU ambassadors participated at no cost. Limitations of the pilot program are noted, and the long-term goal is to expand participation to include students from a wider range of international backgrounds.",Sweden ; International Criminology ; Criminology ; Study Abroad ; Social Justice ; International Law,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/csuglobalaction/vol2/iss1/3

Death to the Museum (As We Know It) A California Art and History Museum Designs a Different Cultural Exhibit,"Pambid, Caitlin","Museums have stuck to traditional rules of focusing interpretation only on the object, having a single exceptional curator, and top-down dissemination of information. One California museum has created a different cultural exhibit that rejects all of these pillars to create an active museum. New Museum Los Gatos (NUMU Los Gatos) recently held an exhibition titled: Reclamation: Resilience of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe. Collaborating with the Muwekma Ohlone, aboriginal to the San Francisco Bay Region, this exhibit spotlights and provides a platform for the Muwekma to the surrounding Los Gatos community who may not be aware of the local indigenous community and their fight for federal recognition. To show how this exhibit can be a blueprint for authentically exhibiting a cultural group, I employ two tools -- five steps referred to as the Processes of Decolonization and the Dimensions of Curation Competing Values Exhibition Model. The model consists of 3 axes, interpretive focus, curatorial power, and curatorial intent. I hope to show readers that cultural exhibitions can and should employ modern ideas of authenticity and practices for proper representation. Employing these strategies ensures museums stop essentializing cultures and reinforcing the museum’s roots in racism and classism.",Museum Studies ; Indigenous Culture ; Repatriation ; Applied Anthropology ; Arts and Humanities ; Curation ; Exhibitions ; Decolonization ; Los Gatos ; Muwekma Ohlone ; Authenticity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/csuglobaljournal/vol2/iss1/1
NGO Advocacy and Immigration Policy Reform in San Diego,"Benavides-Garb, Benicio","The field of immigrant policy is a highly contested space, and among the primary actors involved in immigrant advocacy are non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Throughout California, NGOs are involved at the local, state, national, and international levels. In addition to introducing some of the directions being taken by NGOs in the San Diego area, this paper will examine the work of the San Diego City Council. The included NGOs were selected based on their intentional work in providing “systems-level” support, such as progressive immigration policy reform and advocacy. These organizations are the following: the Partnership for the Advancement of New Americans (PANA), the Border Angels, the California Immigrant Policy Center (CIPC), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of San Diego and Imperial Counties, and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA). The subsequent analysis of the strategies utilized by the aforementioned groups to achieve shifts in immigration policy resulted in the identification of overlapping trends in methods used to achieve policy-focused goals. Three of these methods include coalition building, leadership development, and lobbying. Future uses for the synthesis provided by this work include informing future policymakers interested in progressive immigration policy reform at the local and national levels.",policy reform ; Arts and Humanities ; Nonprofit Studies ; human rights ; immigration ; border state ; International Relations ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Social Work ; American Politics ; nongovernmental organization ; Social Justice,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/csuglobaljournal/vol2/iss1/2
"A Decolonial Approach to International Education Insights from a Cal Poly Global Program in Palermo, Sicily.","pulitano, elvira ; Jamaly, Iyad","This article presents a critical intervention in the current debates about decolonizing international education. It is based on a Global Program in Palermo, Sicily, offered by Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in summer 2023. As both program creator/director and student participant in the program, the authors rely on their personal experience and insights along with expertise in coloniality and decolonial theories. The article focuses on a series of pedagogical activities led by a young group of migrants and refugees who, in the city of Palermo, have come together to form two associations designed and structured to offer new contemporary models of citizenship and belonging. These workshops offered Cal Poly students who participated in the Global Program a tangible lesson of the transformative experience of international education when the power shifts to local experts and communities.",Arts and Humanities ; Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/csuglobaljournal/vol3/iss1/1

"""Distribution of the North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) in Northern California"" Appendix","Appel, Cara L ; Zielinski, William J. ; Schlexer, Frederick V ; Callas, Richard ; Bean, Tim","Western Wildlife 4:17–28, 2017: The North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is one of the most widely distributed mammals in North America, but recent reports have suggested declines in parts of its range in the West. In California, we know little about porcupines’ historical or current status; maps of porcupine distribution conflict considerably. Nevertheless, the species is of interest to natural resource managers. For much of the 1900s, foresters and others primarily treated porcupines as pests because of the undesirable damage they inflict by feeding on trees and gnawing on manmade items in search of salt. More recently, porcupines have been recognized for their role as engineers, contributing important structure and diversity to forest ecosystems, and as prey for the imperiled Fisher (Pekania pennanti). We collected records of porcupine occurrence in the northern half of California since the beginning of the twentieth century, relying on government and private databases, reports from the public, and other sources. These records confirm porcupine distribution in most major regions and habitat types across northern California, in contrast to many published range maps, and most closely resemble the range map based on projections of suitable habitat developed by the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships System (CWHR). We are unable to offer deeper insight into trends of abundance and possible changes in distribution because these records are likely spatiotemporally correlated with observer effort. This work is a first step in what must be a broader statewide effort, and we encourage further research on the distribution, abundance, and ecology of porcupines in California.
The data provided here consists of 363 unique records of porcupine locations in northern California spanning the years 1908 to 2016. Records were obtained from a participant science project (porcufinder.com); internal California Department of Fish & Wildlife records; the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS); internal U.S. Forest Service Records; a study by former HSU Wildlife professor Charles Yocom; iNaturalist; and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The second tab includes descriptions of each column of the data, and additional information is available in the (forthcoming) publication.

What Should Go in a Wildlife Professional’s Geospatial Toolbox? (Response Data),"Bean, William ; Baumbusch, Ryan C ; Berger, Brooke ; Delheimer, Matthew ; Hecker, Lee J ; Lau, Matthew ; Milligan, Megan C","Geospatial tools have become a critical component to most wildlife studies and management questions. With a diversity of approaches available, current and future wildlife professionals deserve guidance on the most important tools to answer these questions. Younger professionals may be expected to know a separate set of skills from those required further on in their career. We conducted an online survey and a year-long search of job advertisements to identify the most important geospatial approaches, techniques, programs, and ancillary skills for wildlife professionals. We provide the results of these 2 efforts so that wildlife professionals interested in geospatial tools can prioritize those most valued in our field. Habitat modeling and home range analysis were the 2 highest-ranked tools. Highly ranked programs included ArcGIS, R, Google Earth, and Geospatial Modeling Environment. We suggest that wildlife professionals should have a geospatial program they are comfortable with and be conversant with the major approaches (e.g., habitat modeling, home range analysis, remote sensing, and mobile mapping) but need not be experts in each field. Younger professionals should focus on the “big picture” tools such as ArcGIS, while professionals further in their career are expected to have some expertise in multiple areas, including knowledge of current and emerging trends.
The data provided here consist of 123 unique responses to a survey administered online via a Google Form to wildlife professionals, from March 13 through May 26, 2015. Respondents were asked a series of questions related to their workplace, their experience with spatial tools related to wildlife management, their estimated value of a suite of spatial tools, and the value of a spatially-based curriculum for wildlife professionals. These data were analyzed and presented in a manuscript in Wildlife Society Bulletin (in press).",habitat analysis ; Science and Mathematics Education ; ArcGIS ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; connectivity ; Geographic Information System ; home range analysis ; remote sensing ; GIS ; training ; Biodiversity ; professional development,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/data/2

"Data Repository for ""North American Porcupine Distribution in the Pacific Northwest and Evaluation of a Non-Invasive Monitoring Technique""","Appel, Cara L ; Moriarty, Katie M ; Matthews, Sean M ; Green, David S ; Anderson, Stacy ; King, Evan ; Yaeger, J Scott ; Brown, Jeremy ; Bortot, Claire ; Bean, Tim","North American Porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) have a broad geographic distribution across much of the continent, but recent evidence suggests that their populations may be declining in some areas, including the Pacific Northwest. Estimating baseline historical and contemporary distributions of Porcupines is necessary for initiating monitoring efforts and, if necessary, informing strategic conservation actions. We compiled 1905 occurrence records of Porcupines in Washington, Oregon, and northern California from 1908 to 2018. Using maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), we created historical and contemporary distribution models based on Porcupine records from 1981–2010 and 2012–2018, respectively, to match the temporal scale of available environmental predictor layers and suspected onset of the decline. Our models suggested a recent shift in the occupied environmental niche of Porcupines in the Pacific Northwest away from forested areas and towards desert scrub and grassland vegetation communities. In addition, we tested a non-invasive survey method for determining Porcupine presence and monitoring their status over time. Our trials suggested that sodium-soaked wood blocks may provide an inexpensive and minimally invasive technique to detect Porcupines, but further testing is needed to understand its effectiveness and limitations.

"Data Repository for ""Use of Redwood Basal Hollows by Bats A Focus on the Townsend’s Big-Eared Bat on the North Coast of California""","Armstrong, Amon J","Loss of roosting resources, either through disturbance or removal, negatively affects bats. Identifying sensitive species and determining roost requirements are critical components in conserving their habitat. Cavity roosting bats on the North Coast of California are known to use hollows in large redwood trees. In this study, we examined the factors determining the use of basal tree hollows by different bat species at eight redwood forest sites in Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino Counties, California. Bat guano was collected from 179 basal hollow roosts from 2017 to 2018, and guano mass was used as an index of roosting activity. Nine bat species and one species group were identified by analysis of DNA in guano. Of 253 species identifications from 83 hollows, the most prevalent were Myotis californicus (California myotis; 28.5% of all identifications), the Myotis evotis-Myotis thysanodes group (17.4%), Corynorhinus townsendii (17.0%), and Myotis volans (15.0%). We evaluated the extent to which habitat variables at the scales of the hollow, vicinity, and site influenced the level of roost use. Correlations between guano mass and habitat variables were examined using multiple regression analyses. At the hollow scale, guano mass increased with ceiling height above the opening. At the vicinity scale, guano mass increased with less cover of small trees. At the site scale, there was no association between guano mass and distance to foraging areas, elevation, or number of nearby hollows. These tree hollow roost preferences can inform land managers when planning conservation and management of redwood forests.",trees ; Population Biology ; bats ; genetic ; roosts ; guano ; Other Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Other Animal Sciences ; Biodiversity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/data/5

The Evolution of Schooling From Industrial Obedience to Techno-Autonomy,"Taylor, Seb ; Roberts, Ron, II","This paper examines the enduring architecture of the American education system as a mechanism designed for compliance, not creativity. Rooted in 19th-century industrial logic, the structure of schooling, its physical design, time constraints, and assessment methods, has remained largely static despite seismic cultural and technological shifts. Through historical analysis and contemporary critique, this work interrogates the persistence of standardized methods, institutional prestige, and top-down instruction as barriers to meaningful learning and value creation.   Drawing from interdisciplinary research and live case studies, including Alpha School’s AI-powered, mastery-based model, the paper advances the concept of techno-education: a student-centered paradigm informed by feedback loops, digital fluency, and real-world autonomy. It proposes feedback economics as a framework to replace credentialism with continuous, adaptive learning. The paper argues that the future of education must be designed from first principles to meet the demands of a networked world, centering identity, agency, and collaboration. To delay this shift is to entrench inequity, misalign incentives, and forfeit the potential of the next generation.",Educational Assessment ; Holistic Education ; Education ; Labor Relations ; Macroeconomics ; Higher Education ; Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education ; Business ; Educational Technology ; Scholarship of Teaching and Learning ; Elementary Education ; Curriculum and Instruction ; Social History ; Curriculum and Social Inquiry ; Economics ; Economic History ; Urban Education ; Economic Theory ; Digital Humanities ; American Material Culture ; American Popular Culture ; Labor History ; Educational Administration and Supervision ; Educational Leadership ; Higher Education Administration ; Intellectual History ; Evaluation ; and Research ; Nonprofit Administration and Management ; Teacher Education and Professional Development ; Humane Education ; Nonfiction ; Labor Economics ; Art and Design ; Public Economics ; Educational Methods ; Education Economics ; Online and Distance Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/digitallab/9

Within this text exchange, the conversation navigates themes of digital preservation, authorship, and self-curation—examining how social media aesthetics transform personal experience into collective memory. @ONLYSTARLEFT reflects on the act of archiving not as static documentation but as a living, participatory practice shaped by the speed and impermanence of online culture.   Formally, the project recognizes the iPhone as a cultural mediator—its interface shaping not only how we communicate, but how we perceive and construct value within digital life. The design reproduces the Instagram environment through typographic rhythm, spatial composition, and visual pacing, translating the aesthetics of the feed into the language of the printed page. At its core, the interview functions as a methodological innovation: it uses conversation itself as a medium of research and design inquiry. By positioning dialogue as a primary creative act, 404MPH reveals how Instagram-based archival practice redefines authorship, memory, and aesthetic circulation in networked culture.

Space for New History Stony Island Arts Bank,"Taylor, Seb","The Stony Island Arts Bank (SIAB) in Southside Chicago was designed and founded as a piece of art itself, with the organizational structure being a museum of Black cultural production. This article examines how the institution constructs an epistemology of Blackness through its archival practices, community programming, and spatial claims on the South Side. Founded by artist Theaster Gates through the Rebuild Foundation, the SIAB positions institutional design as an art medium, operating in productive tension with orthodox museum methods.    The permanent collections—including the Johnson Publishing Company archives and Frankie Knuckles vinyl collection—function as epistemological records of Black self-documentation unmediated by external audiences. Through analysis of these collections and the institution’s community engagement, this article argues that the SIAB holds amorphous space for an alternative theory of history to arise within the conditions of Black expressivity. The critical tensions in place are preservation vs production, sanctuary vs intervention, contemporary vs historic, local vs diasporic.    These tensions create space for the creation of a new theory of history around Blackness—a history where existence is claimed and Blackness is not an addition or a margin but an origin of the contemporary conditions of art. The existence of the SIAB poses a fundamental question: what happens when Black cultural production is allowed to exist undeniably?",Arts and Humanities ; Fine Arts ; Nonprofit Administration and Management ; Visual Studies ; Film and Media Studies ; Art and Design ; Digital Humanities ; Interactive Arts ; Interdisciplinary Arts and Media ; Organizational Behavior and Theory ; Leadership ; Art Practice ; Audio Arts and Acoustics ; Art Education ; Art and Materials Conservation ; Instructional Media Design,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/digitallab/12

Water quality evaluation of tire derived aggregate,"Maeda, Richela K","The primary objective of this study is to investigate the rate that potential water quality contaminants leach from tire-derived aggregate (TDA) as a function of time. A laboratory and field experiment is conducted to provide insight into both controlled and field settings. The laboratory portion of this study also provides a basis for evaluating the effect that alternating periods of wet and dry weather have on the potential water quality impacts of the leachate as compared to the worst-case operating condition, when TDA is constantly submerged (i.e., when placed below the permanent groundwater table). The field experiment is used to determine if the leachate constituents identified in the laboratory experiment are observed when TDA is used as a stormwater filtration media. This portion of the study also determines if a TDA fill followed by a soil layer provides removal of urban stormwater runoff constituents.
The laboratory experiment suggests that, of the 83 tested constituents, benzene, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), cadmium, zinc, iron, manganese, total phosphate, and total suspended solids (TSS) are leached from TDA and dissolved oxygen (DO) is altered by TDA. For the eight constituents suspected to leach from TDA, a decrease in release over time was observed, with release rates for the majority of these constituents reaching values below their respective detection limits by the end of the experiment. Of these constituents with Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs), only iron and manganese exceeded their respective Secondary MCLs, and these standards are an aesthetic rather than a human health concern.
The rate at which metals leach from TDA is the highest when continuously submerged. A higher loss in iron, manganese, and zinc was observed for TDA that was always wet compared to TDA that experienced short (1 to 7 days) cycles of wet and dry. At the end of the 15 month experiment, manganese, zinc, and iron cumulative mass losses (per kg of tire) were 1.7, 1.6, and 2.6 times greater under the always wet operating condition compared to the average of the other operating conditions. There was not a difference in the loss rates that could be attributed to the different wet and dry cycles investigated.
The results of the field experiment suggest that a TDA-soil system provides removal of the following constituents from urban stormwater runoff: acetone, cadmium, chemical oxygen demand, iron, lead, manganese, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), oil and grease, phosphate, and zinc. In addition, the constituents suspected to leach from TDA are removed by a TDA-soil system.
The results of this study have demonstrated that the use of TDA as a fill material in civil engineering applications is a responsible method of recycling automotive scrap tires. TDA fills that are seasonally or always saturated are very unlikely to compromise the quality of the receiving water. The number of potentially harmful compounds leaching from the TDA is limited, and the rate of leaching is sufficiently low that the concentrations of these compounds in the surrounding waters do not pose any environmental degradation. In addition, sufficient dilution and soil adsorption effects further reduce impacts compounds might have on receiving waters. Sufficient dilution and soil adsorption processes further reduce the potential impacts that these compounds might have on any receiving water.",Water quality ; Environmental engineering ; Organics ; Treatment ; Civil engineering ; Metals ; Civil Engineering ; Tire derived aggregate ; Stormwater ; Environmental Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/16
"Access to recreational open space in Patterson, Ca a geospatial analysis utilizing geographic information systems","Lynch, Leanne S.","Many cities throughout California have experienced land use shifts from prime agricultural land to developed industrial and residential areas without considering access to recreational open space. Access to recreation through open space or parks is beneficial for the health and well-being of the community while providing aesthetic value and potential preservation of local ecosystems. Since 2002 the City of Patterson, located in California’s Central Valley, has rezoned over 800 acres of agricultural land for urban and industrial use while developers reserved recreational open space (parkland) at locations inconvenient to existing neighborhoods. Although several acres of parkland have been added to the park infrastructure in new subdivisions, there still may be limited access to parks. This study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data collected through public participatory GIS (PPGIS) surveys to analyze the accessibility of parkland for Patterson residents based on proximity, crime and physical barriers, and statistical probability. Participants in the PPGIS study included citizens living in Patterson, community members employed in Patterson, City and County officials, and farmers whose lands either shared a border to the City of Patterson and/or existed within city limits. About one quarter of the total population of Patterson has low access to recreational open space based on proximity, but more than three quarters of survey respondents felt that there was some kind of barrier keeping them from accessing parks. Some results of this study are available within Patterson’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan Draft. Once the Master Plan Draft is approved, it is hoped that the results of this project will help the City planning department make well-informed decisions on improving access to parks, creating secure paths for children, promoting healthy and affordable alternatives to motor vehicle transportation, and better connect residents with poor access to parkland.

"Leadership, it's everyone's responsibility","Triplett, Bruce A","Abstract
Leadership, It’s Everyone’s Responsibility
Bruce A. Triplett
Leadership is something that is discussed in all facets of life. Specifically in sports, leadership is something that coaches view as an integral part of a team’s success. Although leadership is a crucial component to a team’s success, many high schools do not provide a leadership development program for their athletes. This project was developed to be an introductory leadership course for high school athletes. The curriculum is set up to work around the busy schedules of teachers, athletes, and coaches. The lessons are put together to give the athletes a foundation of leadership, as well as some practical experience throughout. The curriculum can be supplemented to an existing class or be a stand-alone class. If we are expecting our athletes to be leaders, then it is important to give them the skills necessary to succeed. Experience is said to be one of the most important teachers, including the development of leadership. High School sports have the potential to provide this hands-on training opportunity to millions of athletes. Developing leadership skills should be more of a priority in athletics, especially with the prevailing belief that everyone has the ability to learn how to lead.",Educational Leadership ; Student-athlete ; Leadership development,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/2
Warm springs national fish hatchery intake improvements,"McNeil, Chelsea M.","The Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery located in Warm Springs Oregon, is hampered with many issues that impact its effectiveness. In an effort to improve the effectiveness of the hatchery, United States Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) has expressed interest in modifying the existing intake to address a number of specific concerns. Five specific objectives have been identified to define the overall project scope. USFWS desires to provide a means to prevent frazil ice from forming on and around the hatchery intake screens, prevent sediment from collecting behind the weir and entering the hatchery intake, provide effective hatchery screening to prevent sediment, debris, and fish from entering the hatchery intake, decrease intake water temperatures during summer months, improve the intake screen cleaning system, and provide a means for effective water quality treatment to limit spikes in turbidity and therefore improving the effectiveness of the existing ultraviolet treatment.
Concept level improvements were developed to address the objectives. Site visits, interviews with hatchery staff, water quality sampling, hydrologic and hydraulic analysis were completed and record construction drawings of the hatchery were reviewed to confirm concept level improvement feasibility.
Three concept level design alternatives were developed to address the first four objectives while only preliminary water quality sampling was conducted so that separate concepts could be developed in the future to address the fifth objective, effectiveness of the existing sand filters. The concepts developed and evaluated included installation of rotary drum screens or vertical fixed plate screens to replace the existing static drum screens. In addition, the concepts included an a la carte of other options that address the objectives. Those a la carte items include; construction of a rock groin structure, weir improvements to provide an adjustable spillway, and miscellaneous utility upgrades.
From this analysis, Concept 3 - relocating the hatchery intake upstream was identified as most likely to address the objectives and is feasible given the site constraints. More analysis is needed before a recommendation can be made including collection of in-stream water temperature data and a quantification of the amount of sediment expected to accumulate near the proposed intake structure. However, it is also recommended that additional and consistent operation and maintenance at the existing intake could also provide significant improvements to address the objectives in the short term.",Hatchery ; Civil Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/1
Needs assessment of culturally relevant and sensitive domestic violence services for Native American women in a rural Northern California county,"Danis, Noelle L","In this rural northern Californian county, there are four federally recognized tribes, as well as additional non-federally recognized tribes. This county is home to a single encompassing agency that assists those in need of domestic violence services. Indigenous people seeking services have little choice, therefore it is paramount that providers incorporate concepts such as historical trauma and assist those in need with culturally relevant and sensitive services.
A needs assessment was conducted, which was comprised of two distinct parts. The first, was a case study to collect and analyze data from a focus group assembled of Native American women, who have had experiences with domestic violence services within this county. The intent of the focus group was to discern the users’ perspective of services, or why they may not have had sought out services in relation with the users’ cultural identity. Secondly, a survey of local professionals experienced with the Native American community, was conducted seeking individuals’ perspectives. This pertained to culturally sensitive treatments for Native American women.
Based on the findings of the research, it was expressed by participants that additional services are needed in the areas of advocacy, outreach education, counseling, and inclusions of the Native American community and healing practices representative of their culture. A written report, with recommendations derived from information from focus group and surveys, was shared with local domestic violence services, Native American agencies, and tribes.
It is imperative for professionals to hear the voices of the population they intend to serve to create the most effective positive changes. With suggestions, outlined in this written report, the services of these agencies could further benefit the Native American community with regards to domestic violence services.",Historical trauma ; Social Work ; Domestic violence ; Cultural sensitivity ; Native American women,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/15
"Considering ""disparate"" genealogies analogously a survey into the histories of peer response and their impact on current peer response practices","Gorman, Laura P","Peer response is a widely accepted pedagogical approach to teaching writing that goes unchallenged by contemporary compositionists. As a common pedagogical approach to teaching writing, there is a vast amount of scholarship written on the subject; nonetheless, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding unsuccessful narratives on peer response. For this reason, this project considers two seemingly disparate genealogies of peer response and reads them analogously. By reading two histories analogously that are typically positioned in opposition with one another, this project explores a broader definition of peer response and its purpose. The project’s analysis of peer response in these newly defined terms is revealing of the impact framing has on the implementation of peer response in classrooms. This project intends to re-visit this pedagogy as other scholars have, and examine these two histories critically in order to explore the “consequences” of the telling and re-telling of those histories.",Composition pedagogy ; Peer response ; Rhetoric and Composition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/14

Half of the students were asked to write only written notes while the other half was asked to both draw and write down notes during the presentations. Their pre and post test scores were compared to show the growth of the students’ content knowledge showing that the group that was required to both draw and write had on average higher scores than the group that only wrote in their lecture notes. The data and previous literature was used to influence the creation of a work book to be used for educational activities and trips at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California.

Automatic power management for instructional computers at Humboldt State University a calculation of potential energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions,"Flenghi, Nicholas F","Computers consume an estimated 5,610 GWh per year in California alone. Much of that energy is consumed by computers that are not being used. In this project, detailed user login data are used to estimate the energy consumption of instructional computers at Humboldt State University (HSU) over the course of one semester. The data are also used to estimate the potential energy savings from automating the shutdown process. Potential cost savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions resulting from implementing an automatic-shutdown power management plan are also calculated.
There are approximately 1,000 computers used for teaching and learning purposes at HSU. In their current configuration, they consume an estimated 35.4 MWh each semester. However, 56% of that energy is wasted, powering computers that are not being used. By automatically powering down unused computers after 30 minutes of inactivity, significant energy, cost, and GHG emissions reductions could be realized. Energy consumption could be reduced by 45% or 15.9 MWh per semester, saving $1,935 in electricity costs. Consequently, GHG emissions could be reduced by four metric tons per semester, with little to no additional costs and minimal impact to users.",Other Electrical and Computer Engineering ; Power management ; Energy ; Computer ; Greenhouse gas ; Other Computer Engineering ; Efficiency ; Monitor ; Environmental Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/13

"Reintegration in a rural community strengths, barriers, and recommendations for reentry in Humboldt County","Vrtiak, Vanessa E","There is a current lack of reintegration services in rural Humboldt County, California. In an effort to understand the services available, and develop recommendations for future reentry services, I conducted focus groups and interviews with the currently incarcerated, service providers, and the formerly incarcerated. Some of the formerly incarcerated participants live in Humboldt County currently, and some have moved to other communities in the state of California. This research was conducted using a convenience sample, and snow ball sampling methods. The initial goal of this research was to promote communication between both community based service providers and those involved in the criminal justice system. My hope is that this will ease the process of reentry, and reduce the likelihood of recidivism. In addition, this research will aide in the planning and development of the new rehabilitation center for the Humboldt County Correctional Facility.

27 months of solitude a Peace Corps story,"Gordon, Christopher A","In 2014, I was sent to Colombia’s Caribbean coast to serve as an English teacher through the Peace Corps. I spent two years teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) at both the elementary and secondary levels in Colombian public school settings, which included time in both urban and rural areas. Despite many hardships and setbacks, my experience in the Peace Corps was overwhelmingly positive. By teaching the alphabet at the elementary level, and focusing on vocabulary, test-taking strategies, and reading comprehension strategies at the secondary level, I was able to make a positive impact in public schools which had previously never hosted a Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV).
This project tells the story of my experiences during the Master’s International Program beginning with my time at Humboldt State University, followed by my Pre-Service Training in Colombia. As a PCV in Colombia, I describe the four months I spent living, working, and observing English classes in a rural town, before moving to my final site placement. I then describe the remainder of my first year of service co-teaching at the primary-school level, as well as my second year of service co-teaching at the secondary-school level. I also include a description of my community English class, and my after-school English club. More specifically, this M.A. project describes the activities that worked in the classroom as a result of my TEFL training, as well as the activities that did not work in the classroom, often due to the cultural context of teaching on the Colombian coast.

"Assessment of individual photovoltaic module performance after 26 years of field exposure at the Telonicher Marine Lab in Trinidad, California","Rada, Jake","In 1990, 192 ARCO M75 photovoltaic (PV) modules were installed as a part of the Schatz Solar Hydrogen Project at the Humboldt State University (HSU) Telonicher Marine Lab in Trinidad, California, within 150 m of the Pacific Ocean. This 9.2 kW-rated PV array was used to power the marine laboratory air compressor and an electrolyzer. Individual current-voltage (IV) curve tests were performed on each of the PV modules prior to the array’s construction in 1990 and again in 2001, 2010, and, most recently, in 2016, following decommissioning of the array. After 25.5 years of use, 188 of the original 192 modules were operational, significantly outliving their 10-year warranties.
Based on the previous testing results and the 2016 results, the lifetime decline in the maximum power output, at the normal operating cell temperature (NOCT) testing conditions of 1000 W/m2 of solar insolation and 47°C module temperature, of the modules averaged 21.6%, or 8.6 W, with 47% of the modules still producing at least 80% of their original (1990) measured maximum power. The average rate of the power output degradation grew from 0.4%/year in the first decade to 1.4%/year in the second decade, and the average degradation rate over the 25.5 years of exposure came to 0.85%/year.",modules ; Photovoltaic ; Semiconductor and Optical Materials ; Environmental Engineering ; Trinidad Marine Lab ; Telonicher Marine Lab ; Power degradation ; Civil Engineering ; SERC ; PV testing ; Degradation ; PV,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/7
Equine assisted learning with special populations,"Baus, Hanna R","This paper explores the use of equine-assisted learning (EAL) activities with special populations and includes a program evaluation for two equine-assisted learning programs developed and conducted by HeartStrides, a non-profit organization in the Pacific Northwest. The study included two populations (N=18); the at-risk youth program included seven participants and the veterans’ clinic included eleven participants. For the purpose of this study, the participating youth are considered “at-risk” due to their risk factors that include socioeconomic status, exposure to stressful and traumatic events (physical, sexual, and/or psychological abuse), neglect, dysfunctional parenting, substance abuse in the home, self-harming tendencies and/or suicidal thoughts or actions. I conducted quantitative analysis on the pre- and post-survey results for both groups, and qualitative analysis on the veterans’ group survey. The results indicated the EAL activities had a positive impact on the at-risk youths’ resilience, hope, agency and pathways to higher thinking scores. The results showed a positive impact on the veterans’ ability to cope with stress after the completion of the clinic. The results indicate implementation of these activities may have a positive impact on participants’ stress and coping skills. Findings from the analyses suggest these programs at HeartStrides are having the desired effect on participants. Based on the results of this study, and a growing body of literature on the impacts of equine-based programming on various populations, I propose utilizing EAL activities with the formerly incarcerated population in hopes of achieving similar results. Overall, this study adds to research about equine-assisted programs, such as those offered through HeartStrides and other potentially effective EAL programs for an array of special populations.",At-risk youth ; Pacific Northwest ; Community-Based Research ; Veterans ; Equine therapy,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/5
"Motivation, imagination, and the future self in second language acquisition","Stibi, Jason J","This M.A. project explores the theoretical role and classroom implications that imagination has on motivating human behavior, specifically as it relates to second language development. The focus of this project is to examine the current research regarding how imagination and visions of a future self may contribute to motivating language learners. I begin by examining the complex and dynamic nature of human motivation and how a Complex Dynamic Systems Theory approach to second language acquisition prevents over-simplifying the concept of motivation as simple cause-and-effect relationships. Then, I examine the influence possible language learning selves have on motivating individuals, specifically imagining the effects target language knowledge may have on achieving an ideal future self. Finally, I will discuss how guided imagery exercises may be applied in the classroom to enhance language learners’ visions of their ideal self in the future.",L2 Motivation ; Bilingual ; L2 Selves ; Multilingual ; Possible selves ; Imagination ; Second language acquisition ; Dynamic Systems Theory ; Complex Dynamic Systems ; Guided imagery ; and Multicultural Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/6
Reliability and validity of a modified anaerobic speed test to determine anaerobic capacity in NCAA division II soccer players,"Murao, Kenji","Anaerobic capacity is an important performance variable for soccer athletes to compete at higher levels of competition. The purpose of this study was to develop a sports-specific anaerobic capacity test for soccer players that could be administered on commercial treadmills found in most exercise facilities. The Wingate Anaerobic test (WAnT) is the most common test for anaerobic capacity, however it is a cycle ergometer test, which is not sports-specific to running type athletes. The Anaerobic Speed Test (AST) is an anaerobic capacity test on a treadmill, however the testing protocol (20% incline) cannot be done on commercial treadmills because they have a maximum incline setting of 15%. The modified Anaerobic Speed Test (mAST) protocol (15% incline, 244 meter/min) was developed through the use of an ACSM metabolic equation to predict energy expenditure equivalent to that of the AST. 15 subjects playing soccer at the NCAA Division II level participated in this study. Subjects participated in three testing days, one AST trial and two mAST trials all done on separate days. Total run time in seconds was recorded for each trial. Mean AST run times (60.5±10.6) had a significantly strong, positive correlation (p",Anaerobic treadmill test ; Anaerobic speed test ; Modified anaerobic speed test ; Anaerobic capacity ; Treadmill ; Exercise Science ; Soccer,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/4
Abjection in late nineteenth century British literature,"Imholte, Robin A","In this project, I examine three major British works of literature produced in the last two decades of the nineteenth century: Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure. I show that these works reflect popular trends and fears that arose during this time, including notions of decadence and fears of degeneration. Using Julia Kristeva’s conception of abjection, as described in her work Powers of Horror, I argue that developments throughout the Victorian era: namely the advent of the theory of evolution, the rise and expansion of large-scale industrialization, and the moral and economic benefits and ramifications of global colonization, ultimately led to social and individual insecurities that reverberated throughout popular literature of the time. I conclude that these cultural attitudes and insecurities can be seen reflected in works of literature and in their depiction of characters and behaviors whose self-abjection are a reflection of a society with an unstable self-image.",Imperialism ; Theory ; Abjection ; Psychoanalysis ; Victorian Period ; Nineteenth Century ; English ; Literature in English ; English Literature ; English Language and Literature ; British Isles ; Gothic,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/17
Levee stories for an expedited reconnaissance study,"Bromley, Kathleen C","The coordination of earthen levees in Humboldt County, California known as the Redwood Creek Flood Control Project holds mistakes within its design and composition. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) admitted in studies conducted after the sculpture’s completion in 1968 that the levees extended too far into the creek’s estuary and this overreach has yet to be corrected. Poorly negotiated allowances of the levees into the transition zone caused the circulation of the vital water vein to compromise proper supportive nourishment for ecologic health. Economies such as fishing, farming, education and tourism surrounding the waterway have also suffered. Other complexities involved with the levees transmogrify several broader plots of development found thru the arrangements of actions. This research project used ethnographic methods to gather different lines of narrative around the flood control project to advocate for change. In directing heteroglossia analysis with supportive multimodal anthropology, the objective was to reveal the stratagems of the levee system observed as an oeuvre thru its stories that, woven together, compose the significance of the edifice. With this accomplished, the agencies involved can efficiently assign the task of remediation. Methodological triangulation indicated poisonous Lead (Pb) might remain within the ground of the public work. There is a need for these stories to be communicated and for additional investigations to promptly happen for the community.

"Effectiveness of cutaneous antifungal microbe bioaugmentation for disease prevention in the Cascades frog, Rana cascadae, of northern California","Tucker, Jennifer Lauren","The disease chytridiomycosis has caused population declines in hundreds of amphibian species worldwide, and is caused by the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). One promising method to combat the disease is to augment the amphibian's naturally occurring cutaneous antifungal bacterial fauna. I surveyed frogs for cutaneous bacteria across 13 sites among declining populations of Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae) in the Klamath and southern Cascades Mountains of northern California. In vitro challenge assays were used to analyze 182 bacterial supernatants for inhibitory properties against Bd, with 70.33% classified as highly inhibitory, 21.98% slightly/non-inhibitory, and 7.69% as Bd enhancing. The two most effective anti-Bd bacterial isolates were identified as Pseudomonas species by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and tested for anti-Bd properties in vivo on lab-reared recently metamorphosed R. cascadae. Treatments were as follows: Control, Bd only, Bacteria only, Bacteria + Bd, and Bd + Bacteria. During the 70-day lab trial, frogs were weighed, measured for snout-vent-length, and swabbed weekly for Bd zoospore presence/load. Surprisingly, overall mortality was low. Mortality was highest in the Bd only treatment (36.4%) and lowest in the Bd + Bacteria (0%). No mortality differences were seen between the treatments with the two strains of Pseudomonas tested. Zoospore loads revealed frogs were clearing the infection, even in the absence of bacterial treatment. The Bd only treatment had the highest initial zoospore load (30 zoospore equivalents/frog on average). However, the Bacteria + Bd group maintained a higher proportion of Bd-infected individuals than the Bd + Bacteria group. Differences were also found in weight gain/loss, with the Bd + Bacteria treatment being the only group to lose weight (0.07 ± 0.02 g on average). The results from antifungal bioaugmentation suggest that addition of antifungal bacteria to Bd-exposed frogs has a positive impact on survival and reduction in Bd load. A future direction would be to conduct a field trial at Shimmy Lake in the Klamath Mountains using the Pseudomonas sp. identified in this research and collected from the same field site to determine the effectiveness of antifungal bioaugmentation applications on wild populations.",Cascades frog ; Pseudomonas ; Southern Cascades ; Antifungal bacteria ; Quantitative PCR ; Bd zoospores ; Bioaugmentation ; Bd load ; Bd prevalence ; Chytrid fungus (Bd) ; Amphibian decline ; Semi-quantitative spectrophotometric challenge assay ; Klamath Mountains ; Rana cascadaerthern ; Mountain ranges ; Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Biology ; Polymerase chain reaction ; Cutaneous bacterial flora ; Inhibitory potential ; Northern California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1886
The effects of adapted physical education on students with Down syndrome A meta-analysis,"Bolt, Christopher IJ","Objective: The purpose of this study was to synthesize findings from physical activity interventions on children and adolescents with Down syndrome.
Design: The present study employed a quantitative research synthesis design. The overall conclusions of past research highlight important issues related to physical activity interventions performed on children and adolescents with Down syndrome.
Methods: Standard meta-analytic procedures incorporating inclusion and exclusion criteria, literature search, coding procedures, and statistical methods were used to identify and synthesize 24 studies with 258 independent samples. Cohen’s (1988) criteria for effect sizes were used to interpret and evaluate results.
Results: The average treatment effect for all TARGET intervention studies was moderate (g = -0.33; SE = 0.11; 95% C.I. = -0.55, -0.11; p = 0.003) and represented about 3 tenths of a standard deviation advantage for control groups over the treatment groups. Review of the homogeneity statistics revealed a significant heterogeneous distribution (Qт = 74.75, p < 0.05) making it necessary to explain between-study variation through moderator analyses of characteristics coded for studies. In addition, an outlier analysis was conducted through evaluation of residual values and found one independent sample (Ordonez, 2006) to be an outlier (z = -5.13). This prompted the use of a “one-study” removed procedure. The single effect size was retained in the analysis as the results indicated a small change (-0.26) remaining within the 95% confidence interval.
All future quantitative interventions should report all data on all outcomes regardless of their significance level. The most important considerations for the construct of physical activity interventions on children and adolescents with Down syndrome should include the delivery of content from a trained adapted physical education teacher, tasks appropriate for people with Down syndrome, and consistent testing duration to reduce the possibility of physical and cognitive regression. The overall meta-analytic findings indicate that comparing children and adolescents with Down syndrome with their typical developing peers limits our ability to draw firm conclusions on the positive effects of physical activity interventions. More data are needed from the studies to provide a better overall understanding of the current trends in research and application.",Educational Assessment ; Education ; Procedures ; Disability and Equity in Education ; Special Education and Teaching ; Teacher Education and Professional Development ; Early Childhood Education ; Best Teaching Practices ; Educational Methods ; Health and Physical Education ; and Research ; Secondary Education ; Evaluation ; Future Research,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/52
A preliminary study for the development of free weight back squat muscular fitness reference norms for adults aged 19-29,"Marquez, Eden G","The barbell back squat is a simple and common resistance training exercise that is used to evaluate muscular fitness. Its use as an evaluative method for muscular fitness in the general population is limited due to a lack of published reference values for this free weight exercise in the general population. This study presents reference values for the back squat muscular fitness in healthy active young adults (aged 19-29). This data is made of 399 subjects (51% male/49% female). Mean ±SD for participants in anthropometric data were 23.1±2.8 years of age, 73.0±12.9 kg weight, 170.6±9.4 cm height, and 25.0±3.4 body mass index. Subjects performed a squat strength test using 1RM test. A muscular endurance test was done using 65% of 1RM for four sets, performing repetitions to failure, with 30 second’s rest. 6 relative muscular fitness metrics were calculated using subjects body mass, lean body mass, and body mass to the two-thirds power. Absolute and relative data was expressed with the use of percentile categories. Overall mean absolute and relative strength corrected for BM, mean absolute and relative load volume corrected for BM were 213.8±72.6, 1.3±0.4, 2143.2±751.0, and 34.5±11.3. Men performed better than women in 8 of the 9 metrics representing absolute and relative strength and endurance. However, relative squat endurance corrected for lean body mass showed no difference between men and women.

The hurdles we overcome  factors and processes influencing the social and academic integration of non-traditional college students,"Saveliff, Dan","This study examines the factors that lead to attrition among low-income students enrolled in the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) at Humboldt State University, a small rural four-year residential college in northwestern California. The study encompasses three areas of investigation. Part one and two of the study is based on the leading research in the area of student attrition and is modeled after the work of Bean (1990), Tinto (1993), and Cabrera, Castaneda, Nora, and Hengstler (1992), and identifies the non-cognitive factors affecting EOP students, specifically in regard to their academic integration, their social integration, their institutional commitment, and their intent to persist at the institution. Part three of the study identifies indicators that measure the students' high school experiences and identifies which of those experiences correlate with the students' subsequent college experiences. The identification of such correlations suggest that these high school indicators could serve as a predictor for the students' subsequent college integration, institutional commitment and persistence at Humboldt State University. And part four of this study identifies how student adaptation strategies influence the continuity of the students' experiences between high school and college. This would provide a better understanding of how the students' individual agency influences their transition into college and how this individual agency affects the reliability of high school indicators as predictors for subsequent college experiences. The results of the study confirm the findings of earlier research, showing that academic and social integration have a powerful influence on EOP students' in regard to their institutional commitment and in regard to their intent to persist at Humboldt State University. Additional factors found to influence institutional commitment and persistence included peer and parental encouragement for attending Humboldt State University, peer group influences regarding the academic goals of the institution, and the students' level of involvement with their academics. The study also revealed that white students benefīted more from the cultural bias inherent within the institution and that students of color faced larger challenges in regard to their social and academic integration, as well as in regard to their institutional commitment and their intent to persist at Humboldt State University. The study also found two high school measures that had strong correlations with the students' subsequent college experiences, and which could serve as predictive indicators for entering students. These high school measures included peer group influences regarding the academic goals of the institution, and the students' level of involvement with the academic curriculum. And finally, the study found that when students' used an integrative adaptation strategy during their transition into college, the significant correlations found between their high school and college experiences improved, suggesting that individual agency does influence the level of continuity during the students' transition between high school and college.",College students--California--Humboldt County--Economic conditions ; College students--California--Humboldt County--Social conditions ; Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Sociology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1029
The social behavior of an emerging breeding population of Eumetopias jubatus on the coast of Humboldt County,"De Blois, Stephen","A population of Eumetopias jubatus and Zalophus californianus was studied during the summers of 1983 and 1984 on the coast of Humboldt County. The population of E. jubatus and Z. californianus peaked during June and August. Z. californianus numbers peaked again during September. The E. jubatus population probably formed an incipient breeding colony. During June a territorial bull showed sexual interest toward cows and attempted copulation. No pupping was observed. Sea lions moved to drier areas on the study site when tidal height and ocean surge inundated haul-out areas. E. jubatus and I. californianus formed segregated clusters when hauling out. Behavioral interactions between the two species were generally not aggressive. As colony size increased, rate of behavioral interactions decreased. Four age-sex classes of E. jubatus were examined. Old Bulls were highly aggressive toward other Old Bulls, used visual displays of aggression toward Sub-adult Bulls, and showed frequent sexual interest toward Cows. Sub-adult Bulls mock-fought frequently and were highly aggressive among themselves. They displayed a weak sexual interest toward Cows but were usually rebuffed. Cows and Juveniles were usually non-aggressive. Individual E. jubatus did not frequently respond to other sea lions. Such behavior may result from sea lion iii lethargy, or may be an adaptation whereby subordinates avoid antagonizing dominants. Moving E. jubatus also frequently avoided behavioral interactions.",Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Biology ; California sea lion ; Sea lions--Behavior ; Steller's sea lion,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1474
Establishing mindfulness therapy as a resource for homeless individuals,"Rockwell, James","The experience of homelessness is wrought with challenges related not only to meeting immediate needs for daily survival, but also coping with exacerbating risk factors, such as addiction, mental illness, and trauma. These risk factors are pervasive in homeless populations and act as barriers for the resolution of homelessness. Mindfulness Based Interventions (MBIs) are methods adapted from Buddhist Asia that have been shown through three decades of research to be efficacious in the reduction of symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidal ideation, and the impulsivity of addiction. Despite the natural congruency between MBIs and the risk factors associated with homelessness, there is scant research on the implementation of these interventions in homeless populations. This research looks at the effects of an MBI that was implemented with recently homeless individuals in a rapid re-housing facility.The MBI was imagined as an empowerment engine for the all participants, including myself, as researcher. Rather then creating a process focused on concretizing research results via the examination of phenomena, this research prioritized trust building, compassionate caring, openness, and curiosity. In short, the qualities that underlie any loving, healing relationship and the understood fruits of mindfulness practice. The research design emphasized the voices of the participants in an active effort to mitigate the powerlessness and general absence of voice that accompanies the experience of homelessness. Through interviews with some of the MBI's participants, the beneficial effects of the intervention are made plain. In the words of one of the participants, ""This (intervention) helps me inner-relax. I get a sense of calm from not attaching to thoughts. They just come in and go out. It is a real release of anxiety."" The results of this research validate the effectiveness of MBIs to reduce experiences of suffering associated with homelessness. There is a compassionate imperative to make this resource widely available to homeless populations.",Trauma in homeless populations ; Mindfulness-Based Intervention ; Humboldt State University -- Projects -- Social Work ; Addiction in homeless populations ; Mindfulness therapy ; Rapid re-housing ; Mindfulness ; Homeless individuals ; Mental Illness in homeless populations ; Homelessness ; Operational definition for mindfulness ; Empowerment for homeless individuals,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1691
Perceptions of academic achievement in a community college sample,"Burg, Devon","Self-reported GPA is often used in academic achievement research when gathering GPA as a variable, though it is not always completely accurate. Previous studies have shown that actual GPA affects self-report as those with higher GPAs tend to be more accurate. Those with lower GPAs tend to inflate their self-reported GPA. Race has also been identified as a variable that affects self-reported GPA as White students tend to be more accurate than non-White students. Gender has had mixed outcomes with accuracy of self-reported GPA.
Previous research showing self-reported GPA to be a valid measure of GPA has used samples from higher achieving four-year colleges with predominantly White students. This study tested the accuracy of self-reported GPA in a more diverse, lower achieving sample from a community college.
This study has demonstrated that a community college sample of students can produce less accurate self-reported GPAs. While race and gender have shown to have differences in previous studies, these variables did not differ in accuracy of self-reported GPA in this study. The lower accuracy of self-reported GPA in this study is consistent with previous findings of the effects of having a lower GPA.",Imposter phenomenon ; Academic self-confidence ; School Psychology ; Community college ; GPA ; Self-reported GPA,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/395
Developing a strategy to combat the effects of social isolationism in adults with disabilities,"Parker, Greg","Individuals who suffer from physical and mental disabilities often experience emotional difficulties that happen alongside their physical and mental disabilities. These emotional difficulties have the ability to hinder an individual's capacity to learn and grow to their fullest potential. Social isolationism can sometimes be a byproduct of a person with a disability who does not have a strong social or family network. This can lead to negative behaviors such as advanced depression or even thoughts of suicide. This project is a feasibility study of a possible human interaction intervention program. Working under a group theory it is anticipated that through a monthly support group, members of the disabled community can combat isolationism. This feasibility study supports the conclusion that it is possible for Humboldt County to create a psychosocial intervention program that could help reduce the potential negative effects of social isolation issues in adults with disabilities. Some of the key agencies that were focused on were the Humboldt State University Student Disability Resource Center, The Eureka C.A., Adult Protective Services Agency and the Eureka C.A., Hope Center to discuss the possibility of a new programs needs and limitations. This process has the potential to be further developed into reaching out to other vulnerable populations that could possibly greatly benefit for this process. Ultimately this feasibility project is about a greater potential for community growth and interaction for all members of the community. Through our interconnectivity social problems have greater potential to eventually be solved.",Isolation ; Suicide ; Community ; Humboldt State University -- Projects -- Social Work ; Disability ; Psychosocial intervention ; Depression ; Connectivity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/917
Investigating dermal behavioral responses in California red urchins,"Zourdos Williams, Cari Anne","Recent research on sea urchins has shown that they possess unexpected visual capabilities. Behavioral tests have revealed that they are able to detect the spatial distribution and wavelength of light using the surface of their body. The well-studied purple urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) has a larger relative, the red urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus), which provides a number of advantages for studies in phototaxis. Light treatments used red, blue, and ultraviolet LEDs to illuminate one half of an urchin body. My results from red urchin trials agreed with published results from the purple urchin, indicating that both red and purple sea urchins show pronounced, significant negative phototaxis in the presence of blue light. My second study used targeted blue light beams as a probe to attempt to map red urchin responses on the geography of its body. To improve on previous published efforts, novel methods were designed to track an urchin during experimental trials, to analyze behavioral data, and reduce handling effects. Results indicate that a touch or chemical stimulus may confound the stimulus of blue light wavelengths, and that handling bias should be an important consideration in behavioral methods. Based on the results, a new detailed plan is presented for method modification to further research in this system.",Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Biology ; Rayleigh test ; Opsin ; Urchin behavior ; Dermal vision ; Red urchin ; Circular statistics ; Blue light ; Photoreceptors,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1805
Do the arts play an essential role in STEM subjects?  How STEAM professional development affects teacher intent to teach subjects in an integrative manner.,"Young, Stacy N","STEAM, an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics, is an approach to teaching that integrates these subjects together for deeper inquiry and innovation. I surveyed teachers prior to the region 1 STEAM conference in January 2017 and after to determine if they intended to change their teaching practices to integrate what they learned at the conference. Follow-up interviews were conducted to clarify survey results. Research suggests that professional development is a key component to changing teacher practices. This study seeks to extend the assertion that a conference can be the catalyst professional development tool to change teacher practice.
A mixed-method was used for this study, including two surveys and interviews, to examine the scope of STEAM and how it impacted teachers. The 79 teachers who participated in the study attended the Region 1 STEAM Conference in January 2017.
Study findings indicated that teachers found STEAM to be a highly motivating and engaging strategy for increasing academic outcomes for students.

Organizing for power understanding changing conceptions of power in rural community organizing,"Morden, Evan R.","Community organizing is a practice of building and utilizing collective power, often initiated by groups who have little or no preexisting social or economic power. By acting together in a disciplined, organized, and targeted fashion, organizing is used to exert influence in the public square to achieve policy outcomes, provide mutual aid, and reweave the fabric of social relations in communities, frequently in direct opposition to existing power structures. Thus, creating a shared understanding of power that is fundamentally liberative is key to the success of organizing efforts and moreover, to creating lasting community cohesion that can continue to mount effective opposition to domination and oppression. The analyses in this project are the result of in-depth, semi-structured interviews with highly active members of a rural community organizing network, True North Organizing Network, that operates in schools and faith- and spirituality-based institutions in Del Norte and Humboldt counties and adjacent Tribal lands in rural Northern California. Interview data was analyzed in parallel with field notes taken over more than two years of participant observation. Analyses showed strong connections between conceptions of power, spirituality, and conflict that indicate the importance of organizational approaches that challenge normative understandings of dominating power or power over. The project presents these connections and moves towards hypothesizing new methods for analyzing the efficacy of community organizing practices through generating collective shifts in conceptions of power as collective and relational.",Civic and Community Engagement ; Power with ; Rural Sociology ; Place and Environment ; Temporal power ; Politics and Social Change ; Power over ; Economy and Organizations ; Spatial power ; Rural ; Work ; Dominating power ; Community-Based Research ; Movement efficacy ; Community organizing ; Northern California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/599

"Seasonal growth, retention, and movement of juvenile coho salmon in natural and constructed habitats of the mid-Klamath River","Witmore, Shari K.","Juvenile coho salmon (Onchorynchus kisutch) in the Klamath River basin often move long distances when natal streams become inhospitable due to high summer temperatures and high winter flows. Therefore, non-natal rearing sites such as tributaries and off- channel ponds are potentially important to the survival of juvenile coho salmon. This study evaluated the potential benefit to juvenile coho salmon of different types of non-natal rearing habitats in the mid-Klamath watershed including tributaries, beaver-influenced ponds, and constructed off-channel ponds. These sites represent different types of seasonal refugia habitat. Juvenile coho salmon were PIT tagged and measured in ten study sites to evaluate their growth, retention within the habitats, and seasonal movement patterns. Few relationships were found between type of site and growth rate, retention rate, or abundance. However, growth rate of fish which reared year-round in the same site was greater in beaver-influenced sites than in other habitat types. Depth, water temperature, volume of habitat, and percent riparian cover were not correlated with growth rates of coho salmon rearing in those sites. However, because I found significant differences in growth rates of fish across individual sites, there may be other habitat characteristics not measured as part of this study that influence growth. Retention rate was positively correlated with average maximum depth; however the summer retention rate of juvenile salmon at the sites was not correlated with salmon growth at the sites. I observed three seasonal movement patterns of juvenile coho salmon: spring redistribution of fry; fall redistribution associated with initial high flows, and outmigration of smolts during the following spring. A diurnal movement pattern was also detected at the mouths of Tom Martin Creek and Caltrans Pond in which juvenile coho salmon left the study site in the evening and returned in the early morning. This exploratory study showed that not only do juvenile coho salmon in the mid-Klamath display several different migratory patterns; choosing different types of off-channel habitats to rear, but the growth and retention rates of those fish depend on complex and site specific characteristics rather than type of habitat.",Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Fisheries ; Seasonal refugia habitat ; Coho salmon ; Non natal rearing ; Seasonal redistribution ; Growth ; Off channel ponds ; Beavers ; Restoration,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/2162
Relationship between habitat and barn owl prey delivery rate and composition in a Napa Valley vineyard agroecosystem,"St. George, Dane A. R.","The provision of habitat for natural enemies of agricultural pests is common in integrated pest management approaches globally but has rarely been examined for vertebrate predators controlling vertebrate pests. To mitigate the economic and environmental costs of treating for rodent pests, winegrape producers in Napa Valley, California, have installed nest boxes to attract barn owls (Tyto alba) to their properties, but their effectiveness to control rodent pests in vineyards has not been thoroughly tested. A rigorous estimate of the number of rodents barn owls remove from the landscape is a necessary first step, and this study aimed to produce an index of rodent removal and prey composition by using remote nest box cameras. In addition, I tested hypotheses for how habitat may influence prey delivery rates and composition. Results indicate that each barn owl chick received 191 ± 10.01 prey items before dispersing from the nest box. Grassland habitat was an important predictor of prey delivery rate. Prey composition was dominated by voles, gophers, and mice, and their relative proportions were associated with the composition of habitats near a nesting box. Specifically, oak savannah was positively associated with the proportion of gophers, and negatively associated with voles and grassland was positively associated with voles. Further research should focus on the possible roles of rodent abundance, adult owl quality, and additional metrics of habitat structure on prey delivery rates.",Behavior and Ethology ; Prey composition ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Napa Valley ; Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology ; Rodent pest control ; Ecosystem services ; Prey delivery ; Vineyard ; Nest box ; Tyto Alba ; Sustainable agriculture ; Zoology ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Integrated pest management ; Nest box camera ; Barn owl ; Natural enemies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/351
Environmental variables influencing downstream migration of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in three Northern California streams,"Feola, Jennifer E.","The primary objective of this study was to study the migration of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolts in three coastal streams to determine if the probability of migration was correlated with environmental variables. Streams studied were Boyes, Streelow and Prairie Creeks, all located in Redwood National and State Parks, Humboldt County, California during 1999-2003. Smolt migration data consisted of daily catches from fyke net traps operated from 2 March to 6 June each year. Environmental variables included in models included: year, day of year, water temperature, change in water temperature, cumulative degree-days, discharge, change in discharge, lunar cycle, and the interactions of these variables. A partial logistic model using linear stepwise regression was used for analysis of environmental variables affecting coho salmon smolt movement. Akaike's Information Criterion and Bayes statistics were used to select the best models. In Boyes Creek, the significant (p 0.05) variables included within the best model were: year, day of year, day of year2, discharge, change in discharge, the interaction of day of year and discharge, the interaction of day of year and change in discharge and the interaction of water temperature and discharge. In Streelow Creek, the significant (p 0.05) variables included within the best model were day of year and the interaction of day of year and water temperature. In Prairie Creek, the significant (p 0.05) variables included within the best model were: day of year, discharge, water temperature, degree-days and the interaction of day of year and discharge. Another objective of this study was to evaluate the use of PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag antennae in measuring downstream migration of coho salmon smolts during the 2003 smolt migration. The pit tag antennae detected 96% of the pit tagged fish that moved past the antennae into live boxes. Seventy-eight percent of the tagged fish moved between the hours of 20:00 and 07:59.",Probability of capture ; Size frequency distribution ; Year ; Rating curve ; Akaike's Information Criterion ; Binomial expansion ; Darroch Analysis with Rank-Reduction ; PIT tags ; Discharge ; Competition ; Environmental variables ; Partial logistic model ; Fyke net ; Lunar cycle ; PIT tag antenna ; Downstream migration ; Coho salmon ; Change in flow ; Tukey's Honest Significant Difference ; Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Natural Resources ; Northern California ; Day of year ; Coho smolts ; Trap efficiency ; DARR ; Movement ; Flow ; Bayes statistics ; Probability of migration ; Change in water temperature ; Degree days ; Water temperature ; Change in discharge ; Linear stepwise regression,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1158
"Persistence of stream restoration with large wood, Redwood National and State Parks, California","Rodriguez, Diedra L","The conservation and recovery of anadromous salmonids (Oncorhynchus sp.) depend on stream restoration and protection of freshwater habitats. In-stream large wood dictates channel morphology, increases retention of terrestrial inputs such as organic matter, nutrients and sediment, and enhances the quality of fish habitat. Historic land use/land cover changes have resulted in aquatic systems devoid of large wood. Restoration by placement of large wood jams is intended to restore physical and biological processes. An important question for scientists and restoration managers, in addition to the initial effectiveness of restoration, is the persistence and fate of large wood installations. In this study I compare channel change and large wood attributes on the East Fork of Mill Creek, a tributary of the Smith River in northern California, eight years after a major instream wood placement effort took place. I compared my results with previously published data from a few months before and one year after large wood installation.
Since the introduction of complex wood jams to East Fork Mill Creek in 2008, this study found an overall increase in floodplain connectivity, bankfull width, and lower channel gradient leading to an increase in hydraulic complexity. Key log jams designs were found to be self-sustaining; creating cover and resting habitat for adult and juvenile salmonids such as side channel access. Furthermore, self-sustaining log jams further improved rearing habitat for juvenile salmonids by trapping and sorting sediments exposing spawning gravel suitable for Chinook, Coho and coastal rainbow trout. The results observed in this study support several common long-term goals. Future restoration efforts in areas equivalent to East Fork Mill Creek with similar long-term goals may find complex log jams, comparable to the log jams installed in this study, benefiting their project area",redwood ; Stream restoration ; Spawning ; Environmental Sciences ; Monitoring ; Forest Management ; Rearing habitat ; Fresh Water Studies ; Salmon ; Hydrology ; Other Earth Sciences ; Other Environmental Sciences ; Salmonid habitat ; Long-term ; Restoration ; Hydraulic complexity ; Water Resource Management ; Gravel ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Other Forestry and Forest Sciences ; Environmental Monitoring ; Pacific Northwest ; Geomorphology ; Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology ; Residual pool depth ; Floodplain ; Biodiversity ; Log jams,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/153

"Comparison of benthic invertebrate community structure and diet composition of steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Dry Creek, California","Dockham, Andrea Sue","Morphological changes in the Dry Creek (Sonoma County, California) associated with Warm Spring Dam, have reduced habitat availability for rearing fish, and potentially altered the community structure of benthic invertebrates that form the prey-base for juvenile salmonids. I described and compared the structure of benthic invertebrate assemblages and the diets of juvenile steelhead among four stream reaches of Dry Creek downstream of Warm Springs Dam. I hypothesized that if prey availability contributes to factors restricting the success of juvenile salmonids in mainstem Dry Creek, then diet composition should parallel observed differences in reach-specific relative condition and length of juvenile salmonids. Benthic invertebrate assemblages in Dry Creek displayed a longitudinal trend from Warm Springs Dam to the confluence with the Russian River; however, steelhead diet composition did not correspond with reach-specific benthic invertebrate assemblages as expected. Drift-foraging is likely an important feeding strategy for steelhead in mainstem Dry Creek. Steelhead condition and body length corresponded with reach-specific differences in steelhead diet composition. However, reach-specific differences in energetic cost associated with longitudinal differences in water temperature (water temperature was positively correlated with distance from the dam) may be a greater contributor to differences in steelhead size. The relatively high steelhead summer growth rates, in comparison with similar studies, may result from artificially-sustained summer flows in mainstem Dry Creek. Year-round flows in mainstem Dry Creek maintain stream connectivity during a period when non-regulated streams in Mediterranean climates typically become disconnected, therefore increasing food availability and foraging opportunities.",Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Fisheries ; Steelhead diets ; Regulated rivers ; Relative condition ; Oncorhynchus mykiss ; Dam effects ; Longitudinal trends ; Aquatic invertebrates ; Steelhead ; Benthic macroinvertebrates,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/2226
Treatment capabilities of the enhancement wetlands at the Arcata wastewater treatment facility,"Halverson, Heidi M.","The Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility has proposed an upgrade to their system that will modify the flow regime through the treatment facility. This modification will increase the loading of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) to the Enhancement Wetlands (EWs), an important component of the natural treatment system. A review of historical data has shown that the spring and fall months are likely to result in concentrations of BOD and TSS above the permit limits into the EWs (Pt 002). The addition of the new Treatment Marshes (TMs) 5 and 6 have the potential to decrease the concentrations of BOD (by 5-30 mg/L) and TSS (by 5-15 mg/L) entering the EWs if these TMs operate with the same removal efficiency as the original four TMs. The EWs have historically operated over a narrow range of flow conditions. Under the new flow regime, the flow rate will be higher and significantly more variable in the wet season. The EWs have shown performance in the past that suggests they can handle increased loads and still meet permit requirements most of the time, but constantly varying conditions are expected to result in a wider variability of effluent conditions and increased treatment is recommended upstream to reduce the risk of permit violations.",Treatment marshes ; Humboldt State University -- Projects -- Environmental Systems ; Biochemical oxygen demand ; Arcata wastewater treatment facility ; Constructed wetlands ; Enhancement wetlands ; Total suspended solids ; Percent removal ; Pacific Ocean--Humboldt Bay ; Oxidation ponds ; BOD removal model ; Removal efficiency,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1277
“There's no I in team” Student athlete identity at an NCAA Division II university,"Arrington, Jovanah","Student athletes hold a unique identity at colleges and universities all across the nation. They are tasked with the high demands and time constraints of being both a college level student and athlete. While there have been growing conversations about student athletes at Division I institutions, those pertaining to Division II student athletes remain minimal.
While student athletes have a great deal in common, they all come from different backgrounds that have contributed to who they are today. When arriving to college, these unique individuals are introduced to institutional power structures that constrain and control their identities and individuality. These larger power structures have sculpted definitions of what it means to be a “good” student athlete. Meanwhile, society also has defined what a student athlete is. These preconceived notions become even more complicated when using an intersectional approach that takes into consideration the additional identities student athletes hold such as race, class, gender and more. As a result, student athletes are left with the task of living up to the “good” student athlete expectation while also managing a stigmatized student athlete identity. In this study, I used nonprobability and snowball sampling methods to conduct 14 interviews that revealed the ways in which student athletes managed these complex identities. Participants thoroughly talked about the student athlete subculture, hyper surveillance technologies, pressures to sacrifice pieces of their identity and managing a stigmatized identity.

Serotonergic modulation of Mauthner neurons in larval zebrafish,"Purvis, Tyler Chase","In recent decades, zebrafish have become a popular organism in neuroscience research. This is primarily because of the homogenous nature of what are known as reticulospinal neurons. These neurons, located in the hindbrain, control locomotive (e.g., swimming) and escape behaviors via descending axonal connections to lateral musculature. Dominating the reticulospinal neuron group are the Mauthner neurons. This pair of morphologically distinctive neurons is referred to as ""command neurons"" in the reticulospinal group. Recent studies involving antibody labeling reveal a distinctive clustering of serotonin (5-HT) associated proteins in the Mauthner dendritic regions. This would imply that 5-HT plays a direct role in the modulation of Mauthner neuron activity. In this study, we attempt to experimentally demonstrate a functional relationship between 5-HT and the Mauthner neuron through the administration of the SSRI fluoxetine and Ca²+ imaging techniques. Results indicate no significant change Ca²+ and latency of response. Interestingly, these data indicate a difference in responsiveness (i.e., firing or no firing) with the fluoxetine group showing an 8% increase.

Analysis of low-cost testing methods for LED lumen maintenance of off-grid lighting products,"Carlsen, Christopher","Two low-cost test methods for measuring the lumen maintenance of off-grid lighting products, a box-photometer and a tube-photometer, were compared to a high-accuracy integrating sphere system in order to evaluate the measurement error of the low-cost testing devices. Results from this study indicate that the box- and tube-photometers can be used to accurately measure the relative change in light output of typical off-grid lighting products. The tube and box are simple and inexpensive to construct, and they are quicker and easier to use than an integrating sphere system. The box-photometer and tube-photometer are recommended for use in testing off-grid lighting products according to the Long-Term Lumen Degradation Test specified in Lighting Africa's Quality Test Method and Initial Screening Method. The box's strengths lie in its versatility and ease-of-use. The box-photometer can be used for testing product run-time and lumen maintenance, and a single measurement can be conducted in a matter of seconds by a minimally trained technician. The tube- photometer, while nearly as easy to use as the box, excels in terms of constructability, cost, and physical size. A tube-photometer can be built of basic materials that are widely available at very low cost. No specialized tools or skills are necessary to build the device. The tube-photometer is small, light and portable, allowing for easy storage and minimal space for operation. Results from this study indicate that a small degree of measurement error can result from improper use of the low-cost devices. Box-photometer measurements are susceptible to error caused by changes in the light source location and orientation, especially for highly directional and adjustable products. The tube-photometer is prone to small errors due to false identification of the maximum illuminance measurement. These errors, however, can be easily minimized by repetition of measurements and training test operators to use the equipment properly.",LED lumen maintenance ; Off-grid lighting products ; Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Environmental Resources Engineering ; Low-cost test methods,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1512

"A mark-recapture study of the wandering salamander, <em>Aneides vagrans</em>, in a redwood rain forest canopy","Spickler, James C.","I investigated seasonal activity, movement patterns, and habitat use of the wandering salamander, Aneides vagrans, in an old-growth forest canopy. During the fall and winter months from September 2000 to January 2003, a mark—recapture study of salamanders was conducted in the crowns of five large redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Humboldt County, California. This represents a first attempt to describe the arboreal behavior of A. vagrans. A cover object approach limited damage to fragile canopy habitats. Litter bags were placed on 65 randomly selected fern mats, covering 10% of the total surface area of epiphytic fern (Polypodium scouleri) mats in each tree. Crack boards were also placed on one fern mat in each of two trees. These cover objects were then checked 2-4 times per month during the field season. Captured salamanders were marked by injecting tags near the base of the tail. A total of 52 captures were made of 40 individuals, including 15 recaptures. One salamander was captured on 4 occasions over the 3-year study period. Only one recaptured salamander moved (vertically 7 m) from its original point of capture. There was no evidence of territorial behavior by A. vagrans in the canopy. Salamander captures were compared to tree-level and fern mat-level variables with correlation analysis and stepwise regression. At the tree-level, the best predictor of salamander abundance was the total mass of fern mats in crotches. At the fern mat-level, the presence of crack boards accounted for 85% of the variability observed in captures, while the mass and height of the fern mat accounted for the remaining 6% explained by the model. Population estimates were made by applying the Lincoln-Peterson method to the capture data. This analysis revealed that individual redwoods can support at least 28 individual salamanders associated with fern mats. By virtue of their high water-holding capacities, large fern mats likely enable year-round occupation of the redwood forest canopy by A. vagrans. Anecdotal observations of A. vagrans and its close relative A. ferreus by scientists and forest activists strongly suggest that these salamanders also occupy additional habitats in forest canopies, especially rotting wood and fire cavities.",Humboldt County ; Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Biology ; Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park (Calif.) ; Salamanders ; Ecology ; Coast redwood ; California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1953
"Mortality salience, consideration of future consequences and behavior in a commons dilemma","Reynolds, Christopher","When a resource is limited, it may be depleted by individual users acting in a rational, self interested way. The same resource might be sustained if the users act collectively so as to restrain their consumption for the common good. Such a resource situation constitutes a dilemma, a resource or commons dilemmas resulting from a conflict in self and community interests. Sometimes the dilemma is also viewed as a conflict between short term and long term interests. Examples of commons dilemmas are the harvesting of trees in the forest and fish in the oceans. Environmental influences such as exposure to mortality and individual difference variables such as consideration for the future consequences of one's actions have been theorized to impact the amount of cooperative behavior (as opposed to self interested-behavior) in commons dilemmas. It was hypothesized that mortality salience would increase consumption and donation behavior within commons dilemmas simultaneously. It was further hypothesized that cooperative behavior within a commons dilemma would be predicted by higher amounts of the construct of consideration for future consequences. Participants were assigned to either a mortality salience or control condition. They also completed a measure of consideration of future consequences, and participated in commons dilemma simulations. Death related constructs were more readily available for participants in the condition exposed to the mortality salience manipulation of watching a short news clip. Participants in this condition also consumed significantly more resources and donated significantly more money in commons dilemma situations. A measure of consideration for future consequences was found to be a useful tool in predicting donation behavior in a commons dilemma (under the control condition) but was not found to be effective in predicting the amount of consumption within a resource dilemma. This research constitutes the first time a mortality salience manipulation has been found effective at Humboldt State as well as the first time mortality salience has been tested with multiple types of dilemmas simultaneously. Consideration of future consequences was also suggested as an individual difference impacting behavior within commons dilemma situations.",Mortality salience ; Consideration of future consequences ; Terror management theory ; Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Psychology ; Commons dilemma,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1007
Solar+ microgrid costs at gas station and convenience stores in the state of California,"Quinn, Thalia","This project estimates the capital costs for Solar+ microgrids for the year 2018 and forecasted out to 2030. Solar+ systems include the use of battery energy storage, solar energy, electric vehicle chargers and control systems to manage energy consumption and generation for a single building and provide islanded “microgrid” features. The capital cost includes estimates for the components: DER technologies (battery, solar PV and EV charging stations), controls (programming and hardware), and integration costs (switchgear, engineering, permitting and site work). Methods used to estimate each cost included assessing historical and projected costs for each of the components.
Five Solar+ scenarios are evaluated to forecast the estimated total project cost, the separate component costs, and the variability of these estimates. The scenarios considered constructing Solar+ systems to fit gas station and convenience stores with varied sizes (small, medium, and large) and goals (resilient scenarios). The average capital cost projections for each scenario show that costs are expected to decrease by 50-60% by 2030, with today’s unit cost at $4.8/W for a medium Solar+ microgrid. Changes in cost for each scenario show dependence on the system specification, including size of the battery system and solar PV. EV charging infrastructure has the greatest impact on the total cost and is reported as the largest cost contributor for all scenarios in the future. Additional results from this project suggest that medium to large Solar+ systems have the lowest unit cost currently (in 2018), but smaller Solar+ systems will have comparable costs by 2030 at roughly $2.0/W.",Building controls ; Solar ; Cost ; Microgrid ; Computational Engineering ; Batteries ; EV charging ; Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/274
Homelessness to permanent supportive housing promoting housing as healthcare in rural communities,"Weiland, Alex","Programs and federal resources aimed towards homelessness have historically been geared towards providing emergency assistance instead of long-term housing. The advent of permanent supportive housing (PSH) initiatives over the last two decades supports the Housing First theory, which recognizes housing as a form of harm-reduction and healthcare to those who are chronically homeless. Permanent supportive housing provides stable housing to those with co-occurring disorders, and also offers services to address client medical conditions. Although permanent supportive housing efforts have gained recognition for successfully re-stabilizing many chronically homeless individuals who reside in sprawling urban cities, this model has only recently been applied to serve rural homeless communities. As a result, current research has been overwhelmingly focused on urban models of permanent supportive housing, while largely ignoring the examples of this model as applied in rural dwellings. With an increase in rural-based PSH efforts, this project aims to address this gap in literature by comparing the impacts of both housing models. As there are no existing studies that examine the impacts of both PSH models, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the effect of permanent supportive housing to rural homeless communities compared to that of urban communities. This exploratory research analyzes pre-existing survey data collected by a rural PSH non-profit agency as well as archival sources to measure the impact of urban models.",Arcata ; Scatter-site ; PSH ; Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Sociology ; Permanent ; Urban ; Health ; Supportive ; Housing ; Perception ; Rural ; Housing First ; Service-provision ; Harm reduction ; Single-site ; Homeless ; California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1959

Secondly, there would be a positive correlation between the age of a participant and their score on the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men scale (ATLG). The third hypothesis was that there would be a negative correlation between participants' amount of TV watched with gay male or lesbian characters and their score on the ATLG. And lastly, that there would be a negative correlation between the number of parasocial relationships a participant has with gay male or lesbian characters and their score on the ATLG.

"Effects of resource availability on foraging trip duration in the silver bee, Habropoda miserabilis","Monroe, Jane","Habitat fragmentation can have negative effects throughout an ecosystem, but its impact is dependent on the spatial scale at which community members respond to the environment. Because solitary bees are central-place foragers, their access to floral resources is constrained by their nest location. Therefore, if habitat fragmentation causes the distance between nest and resource patches to be larger than the spatial scale at which a bee species interacts with its environment, bee fitness may suffer. I used foraging trip duration as a measure of bee response to differences in levels of resource availability at various spatial scales to determine the foraging range of the silver bee, Habropoda miserabilis. I timed 260 foraging trips and mapped pollen availability in the silver bee's habitat. The results suggest that the silver bee responds to its environment at a broad spatial scale. Several factors, including weather conditions and individual foraging ability, contribute to the complexity of the relationship between foraging trip duration and resource availability, but the silver bee seems to be unaffected by small-scale habitat variation. Because the silver bee can easily fly the width of its dune habitat, this bee may act as a ""pollination bridge"" between scattered patches of dune-mat vegetation, and is therefore critically important to the ecosystem's health, especially in light of increased habitat fragmentation inflicted on the dunes by invasive plant species.",Humboldt State University -- Theses -- Biology ; Pacific Ocean--Humboldt Bay,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/etd/1799

"''Thanks for the [land] acknowledgement, now what?'' Settler Histories and Decolonial Futures at Cal Poly Humboldt's Schatz Tree Farm","Sarkar, Sangeeta","As California's newest polytechnic university, Cal Poly Humboldt is often lauded for its Indigenous-­facing programming and commitments to Indigenous peoples. In recent years, Native American Studies faculty, staff, and students, alongside Indigenous community partners, have led conversations about Cal Poly Humboldt meaningfully supporting tribal sovereignty by returning land to Native nations. As Cutcha Risling Baldy summarized in a research interview, ""Thanks for the [land] acknowledgement, now what?"" (2024, personal interview). However, though Cal Poly Humboldt has made various land acknowledgements and references to Indigenous peoples in its university policies, conversations about #LandBack have been met with resistance from the university. As my graduate research project, I use the Schatz Tree Farm as a case study to examine attitudes around land return at Cal Poly Humboldt. Donated to the university in 1987, the Tree Farm, which is located on unceded Mewiyinfuk (Mad River Whilkut) land, now serves as a teaching, research, and demonstration space for the university. Mewiyinfuk descendants are currently enrolled in the Hoopa Valley Tribe and Blue Lake Rancheria, making the tree farm a candidate for land return. Through document analysis and a series of IRB­-approved interviews, I explore the history of the Tree Farm, the ways in which settler colonial logics are continually reproduced and maintained by Cal Poly Humboldt, and opportunities for the university to decolonize the Tree Farm by returning the land to Native nations.",Social Justice ; Indigenous Studies ; Food Studies ; Native American Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/foodfutures/vol2/iss1/3
Place-Based Learning Practices Institutional Responsibilities,"Rojas, Karley","The 'Place-Based Learning Practices Project' (PBLP) is a graduate project under the Native American Studies Department Rau Dalagurr Food Sovereignty Lab and Traditional Ecological Knowledges Institute (FSL). Making contributions at the intersection of Western academia and Indigenous science, it imagines and realizes content, policies, and protocols surrounding two case studies and the larger cal poly humboldt (cph) institution which respect, honor, and uplift Indigenous sovereignty and resurgence in partnership with the Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe and the greater regional tribal community. Encompassing two projects internal and external to the institution, I aim to address the construction of controlled and protective environments for research with sovereign Indigenous sciences and Traditional Ecological Knowledges (TEK), while also advancing the products and projects through cábula and Indigenous community-based participatory action research paradigms (ICBPAR) to realize material and functional applications for the partnered communities. The internal case study of the institution is 'Landscape (Hi)Stories of Wiyot Plaza', which includes the 'hsu Ethnobotanical Map', and Wiyot Plaza Site (Hi)Story- an Indigenized Environmental Site Assessment, produced through the lens of trauma-informed care and archival disordering. Appropriate research and data sovereignty structures for doing work with sovereign Indigenous sciences are also explored and proposed for institutional adoption. External to the institution is a second case study with the Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe ( BLR), the 'Living Database and Indigenous Agroecosystems' Project, which includes a feasibility study for the production of a Living Database of Relational Knowledges, the production of a Tribal Research Protocol, and resulting informed projects in Indigenous agroecology. Both case studies contribute to the overarching work of establishing appropriate community collaboration protocols and best practices for the larger campus community regarding Indigenous knowledges and sciences in place-based learning and research, rooted in Indigenous worldviews of relationality and reciprocity, which forefronts the health of relationships with the regional tribal community.",Social Justice ; Indigenous Studies ; Food Studies ; Native American Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/foodfutures/vol2/iss1/4
"Campesino World-Building Stories of Migration, memory, and Care in the Tension of the Colonial Frame","Ríos Gómez, Chelsea","Campesinos, often reduced to the label of “farmworkers”, are too often seen only through the lens of their labor within profit-driven systems. This thesis disrupts that limited narrative by illuminating the rich, expansive nature of vivencias campesinas, ways of being that transcend capitalist measures of value. These vivencias are lived, embodied experiences rooted in campesino lifeways, encompassing cultural, spiritual, and relational practices that nurture and sustain life.
My research is guided by four central questions: (1) In what ways have campesinos in pixley resisted exploitative labor systems, and how can this resistance be understood as a form of care labor? (2) How have both land and the labor of campesinos in pixley been transformed through time? (3) Why is it important to recenter the lived, experiences, Indigenous knowledge and worldview of campesinos? What more-than-human relationships do they highlight? (4) In sharing the collective stories of campesinos in pixley: how do they transform our understanding of vivencias campesinas today?
Through the lens of resistance and care labor, this work examines the transformative role campesinos have played throughout the central valley, highlighting their continued resistance to exploitation as an act of care and community building. The recentering of Indigenous knowledge systems and lived experiences aid in understanding the relational and reciprocal ways of being in vivencias campesinas.",Social Justice ; Indigenous Studies ; Food Studies ; Native American Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/foodfutures/vol2/iss1/5

Mapping Ghost Towns in the Santa Cruz Mountains,"Brewer, Sarah Christine","This project identifies areas of archaeological sensitivity for historic resources related to the segment of the South Pacific Coast Railroad that spanned from Los Gatos to Glenwood in the steep terrain of the Santa Cruz Mountains in Central California. The rail line was only in use for 60 years (1880-1940) until the completion of a major highway drew travelers to greater automobile use. During the construction and operation of the rail line, small towns sprouted at the railroad stops, most of which were abandoned along with the rail line in 1940. Some of these towns are now inundated by reservoirs. This project maps the abandoned rail line and “ghost towns” by using ArcGIS Pro (version 2.5.1) to digitize the railway, wagon roads, and structures shown on a georeferenced topographic quadrangle created in 1919 (Marshall et al., 1919). Through spatial analysis, an area of archaeological sensitivity was created that identifies where artifacts and features related to the railway and its associated towns from turn of the 19th Century are likely to be found.",History ; Archaeological Anthropology ; Geographic Information Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/gspproject/1

Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the Humboldt Bay Area,"Powers, Sharon","In 2015, Northern Hydrology Associates published ""Humboldt Bay Sea Level Rise, Hydrodynamic Modeling, and Inundation Vulnerability Mapping,"" which includes GIS files mapping various sea level rise scenarios. Featured are scenarios with 1 and 2 meters of sea level rise with 100-year flood events.
A 100-year flood historically has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year but can occur in shorter intervals (for example, the floods of 1955 and 1964). The 100-year flood is a concept used for insurance and land use planning purposes and does not take sea level rise or associated rising groundwater into account. These are floods that do a lot of damage, but nuisance flooding from less extreme events will cause damage, temporary road closures, etc. more frequently as sea level rises.
The report and SLR inundation scenarios in Google Earth KMZ files and ArcGIS shapefiles for various scenarios are available on the Coastal Ecosystems Institute website.

The Sea Also Rises,Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury,"The public interest in SLR inspired the Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury to investigate why SLR is happening, how damaging its effects will be, and what must be done to adapt to it.
In September 2022, the conclusion of a study conducted by the County’s Planning Department is expected to recommend the collaborative approach that should be pursued to address SLR around Humboldt Bay. It may be as simple as an informal working group or as formal as a newly created regional agency. Whatever recommendation is forthcoming, the Grand Jury recommends it should be established as soon as possible due to timing and cost factors.
All projects planned along California’s coast require permits from regulatory agencies. Depending on the project, multiple permits are often required. These take time (often years) and are a common complaint among planners and project engineers. In addition, SLR mitigation and adaptation projects are extremely costly. Therefore, the Grand Jury recognizes that our locally elected state officials should be asked to help expedite our SLR plans and assist the County in securing funding from all available sources: state, national, and non-profit foundations.
The Grand Jury believes SLR planning needs to be a priority among all elected officials in the County. The County of Humboldt; the cities of Arcata and Eureka; and the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation, and Conservation District should formally state their immediate and continuous support for, and commitment to, SLR mitigation and adaptation efforts.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/isfsi_local/12

Civilian Nuclear Waste Disposal,"Holt, Mark","RL33461
Management of civilian radioactive waste has posed difficult issues for Congress since the beginning of the nuclear power industry in the 1950s. Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The United States currently has no permanent disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel or other highly radioactive waste.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository. NWPA requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop such a repository, which would be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted DOE’s repository site studies to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository to NRC on June 3, 2008. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain project, citing excessive water infiltration, earthquakes, volcanoes, human intrusion, and other technical issues",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/isfsi_state/21

Consolidation of Key Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Information for Humboldt Bay by Hydrologic Unit,"Laird, Aldaron","The purpose of this task is to create a region-wide geospatial GIS database of sea level rise vulnerability statistics/findings from these assessments to facilitate prioritizing hydrologic units and/or assets for adaption planning for the six hydrologic/hydrographic units on Humboldt Bay. These six hydrologic units (Mad River Slough, Arcata Bay, Eureka Slough, Eureka Bay, Elk River Slough and South Bay) each share a common shoreline and exposure to tidal inundation. In addition to the six hydrologic units there are 24 hydrologic sub-units with shorelines consisting of diked structures. The hydrologic units encompass a tidal inundation footprint for 2.0 meters (6.6 feet) of sea level rise while the sub-units encompass just 1.0 meter of sea level rise (the sub-units begin to merge with increasing levels of sea level rise) (Figure 1), and include three local coastal program jurisdictions.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/1

Sea-level observations and highway level surveys confirm that land is subsiding in Humboldt Bay, in contrast to Crescent City where the land is rising. Rates of sea-level rise are 5.84 mm/yr in South Humboldt Bay (Hookton Slough), 3.76 mm/yr at Fields Landing, 4.61 mm/yr at the North Spit, 2.53 mm/yr at Samoa, and 3.39 mm/yr in Arcata Bay (Mad River Slough). Rates of land subsidence are -3.56 mm/yr in South Humboldt Bay (Hookton Slough), -1.48 mm/yr at Fields Landing, -2.33 mm/yr at the North Spit, -0.25 mm/yr at Samoa, and -1.11 mm/yr in Arcata Bay (Mad River Slough).",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/23

The vulnerability rating uses combinations of shoreline attributes (cover type and relative elevation to modeled mean monthly maximum high water) to rank a shoreline segment’s vulnerability to erosion and/or overtopping due to extreme tides, storm surges, and future sea level rise. Shoreline segments were given a rating between 2 and 10, 2 being the least vulnerable and 10 being highly vulnerable. Ranking shoreline vulnerability will assist in identifying assets at risk of flooding in the near-term from existing coastal hazards of shoreline erosion or overtopping.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/25

"California Dreamin’ Industrialization, The Progressive Movement, and the Americanization of the Russian Molokans","Cutillo, Ryan","At the dawn of the twentieth century, a wave of Russian Molokan immigrants arrived in Southern California, bringing with them dreams of religious freedom, agrarian simplicity, and communal self-determination. What they encountered instead was a complex web of industrial ambition, Progressive idealism, and American social engineering. This paper traces the Molokans’ journey from the Caucasus to the barrios of Boyle Heights and the fields of Baja California, highlighting the often-overlooked intersections between philanthropy and profiteering, altruism and assimilation. Figures such as Rev. Dana Bartlett, C.P. de Blumenthal, and Peter A. Demens emerge not only as benefactors but as agents in a broader campaign to reshape immigrant identity in the image of American modernity. As the Molokans struggled to preserve their language, faith, and way of life amid English classes, labor contracts, and “citizen factories,” a generational divide widened—one marked by the fading echoes of Russian hymns in American schoolyards and the loss of cultural continuity to the demands of industrial capitalism and patriotic conformity. This study contends that the Molokan experience exemplifies the quiet unraveling of an immigrant community caught between spiritual conviction and the machinery of assimilation.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/histpaper/1

Kirby-Bauer Disc Diffusion Method Indicates Absence of Antimicrobial Properties in Ariolimax columbianus Mucus,"Balfe, Elsa ; Kowalski, Elizabeth ; Leavitt, Stephanie A","Antibiotic resistance is a rapidly accelerating epidemic demanding novel approaches. Gastropod mucus has been shown to possess antimicrobial properties and could potentially be used as an ingredient in antibiotic development. However, whether the mucus of Ariolimax columbianus, the banana slug, also displays antimicrobial properties is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the mucus of A. columbianus is resistant to Escherichia coli (E.coli), Streptococcus aureus (S.aureus), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae), three medically relevant strains of bacteria. Specimens were collected from a coniferous forest and isolated for downstream mucus extraction. We spread uniform concentrations of our bacteria on Mueller-Hinton agar plates and subjected them to a Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test by treating them with either discs dipped in mucus or discs dipped in mucus and HBSS. Zones of inhibition did not form on the plates after subjecting the bacteria to either treatment. While this study was limited to a few taxa and one experimental approach, our study suggests that gastropod mucus may not have a generalized scope of antimicrobial activity. Rather, antimicrobial activity of mucus may be more specific to taxa encountered by the slugs in their redwood forest habitat. Our results can be used to refine mucus extraction methods for A. columbianus in future studies that seek to investigate the potential of mucus for biotechnological applications.",Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/2
Investigating the Impacts of Ammonium Phosphate-Based Fire Retardants on Cyanobacteria (Anabaena) Growth,"Sutter, Gavin ; Gonzalez Flores, Brenda ; Laskey, Grace ; Jurak, Shane","In recent years the effects of climate change have taken a devastating toll on ecosystems around the world. With high temperatures and extreme droughts, wildfires have become increasingly common. In order to combat these natural disasters wildland firefighters, drop millions of gallons of fire retardant on public lands and forests. These fire retardants consist of between 80%-100% ammonium phosphate which are incredibly effective as fire suppressants yet is more commonly known for its use in fertilizer. Ammonium phosphate fertilizers can lead to stream eutrophication and undesirable environmental impacts. Our research aims to address the effects of fire retardant on growth in cyanobacteria, specifically Anabaena — a filamentous, nitrogen fixing genera common to North America and responsible for many of the large, toxic cyanobacteria blooms found during summer months. We hypothesized that fire retardant, which is made up of mostly ammonium phosphate, will act similarly to ammonium phosphate fertilizer and cause an increase in growth in Anabaena cultures grown in a lab environment. After a 11-day growth curve experiment, results showed no differences in growth between microcosms treated with ammonium phosphate or fire retardant, supporting the hypothesis that fire retardants can have similar effects to ammonium phosphate-based fertilizers when released in the environment.",Anabaena ; Fire Retardant ; Cell Growth ; forest fire ; Cyanobacteria ; Fertilizer ; Eutrification ; climate change ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/4
Beer-spoilage Bacterial Strains in Large and Small Corporations in Breweries,"villalobos cazares, darlene A ; Pastor-Nuila, Xena ; Acosta, Ernesto ; Cruz-Lopez, Johana","Bacteria-spoilage strains are the root cause of unwanted flavors and unaesthetic appearances of beer. This accidental introduction of bacteria is causing economic loss to businesses and is affecting the health and loyalty of the breweries' consumers. The two most studied strains are from the genera Pediococcus and Lactobacillus are a result of either primary or secondary contamination from the production process. Craft beers, such as Hazy Beers, produced by small-scale breweries are more prone to spoilage than commercial beers produced by large-scale breweries. The goal of this study is to test for the presence of bacteria-spoilage strains in small-scale breweries and large-scale breweries to determine if production size has a direct effect on bacterial growth in their final product. Using the spread plate technique, we inoculated two different media with six beer samples in an anaerobic environment and observed growth using the gram staining method to identify the strain by looking at the bacteria’s morphology under the microscope. Hazy Lady IPA, produced by Six Rivers Brewery, a small-scale brewery, was the only beer in our sample size that showed significant growth on both WLDs media showing significant Lactobacillus and Pediococcus bacterial contamination. Future studies should continue to explore the relationship between production size and bacterial contamination in larger sample sizes to determine if this correlation is unique to Humboldt County’s small-scale brewery, Six Rivers, or all small-scale breweries.",Bacterial Spoilage ; Beer ; Contamination ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/5
Essential Oils and their Antimicrobial Effect on Serratia Marcescens,"Davies-Hughes, Seren C ; Marquez, Patricia I ; Schulz, Henna N ; Sanchez, Laura S.","S. marcescens is a gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium that is particularly aggressive in its growing capability. It is a concern in medical fields as well as home environments due to its resistance to most antibiotics, high mortality rate, and easy ability to colonize on soap and other fatty substances. Although testing of natural cleansers such as lemon juice, vinegar, and ammonia has been done on S. marcescens and essential oil efficacy has been tested on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, no literature has been published on the effect of essential oils on S. marcescens growth. The purpose of this experiment therefore was to test the efficiency of essential oils in inhibiting the growth of this bacterium. Using Kirby-Bauer Assay and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration testing we compared the effectiveness of different harsh cleaners such as Lysol®, with peppermint and helichrysum essential oils. Although few significant values were obtained, noticeable zones of inhibition were seen, especially for peppermint oil. Based on this finding, further research should be done exploring this potency of peppermint and other essential oils on S. marcescens.",Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/6
Kom-Butcher of Pathogens,"Peña, Mel ; Chamu, Yazmin ; Lea Davis, Laura","The antimicrobial properties of kombucha are not well understood, but it is believed that they can be used against foodborne pathogens. In this study, its effectiveness was tested against two common food-borne and one yeast pathogens (E. coli, S. aureus, and C. auris). Three popular store-bought kombuchas (GT Synergy, Moss Beach, and Health-Aide Raw) and one home-brewed kombucha were used to study the antimicrobial properties of kombucha. Several nutrient broth tubes were individually inoculated with the microbes in question and were treated with kombucha (Figures 1-3). There were indications of bacteria settling at the bottom of all tubes except the three control samples (E. coli, S. aureus, and C. auris) that had no kombucha added. A white layer of pellicle (a byproduct of kombucha fermentation) was present on all three GT kombucha samples. The results indicate that homebrewed kombucha was more successful at inhibiting the growth of the chosen microorganisms when compared to the three store-bought versions. Related studies are important as kombucha is shelf stable on its own and has the potential to be used as a food preservative as well as an aid in the maintenance of our gut microbiome.",Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/7
Diatom Abundance and Diversity Across the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant and Wildlife Sanctuary,"Red Bird, Rhiannon ; Curry, Anna K ; Ayon, Brandy R ; Pierson, Kellie N","Wastewater management is an essential component of modern society that is necessary for reducing human environmental impact, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. In Humboldt County, California, the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Plant and Wildlife Sanctuary (Arcata Marsh) is a model for other wastewater treatment plants worldwide to treat waste naturally, reducing the use of chemicals. This wastewater is then discharged into the Humboldt Bay. It is well known how treatment helps remove harmful waste materials, but it has not been investigated how phytoplankton diversity is affected before, during, and after treatment. Phytoplankton are primary producers that are responsible for carbon sequestration and production of oxygen, and are an essential food source for higher trophic-level organisms. When nutrient levels are high, such as in human waste water, it can lead to single species proliferation, thus resulting in lower diversity and higher abundance of other species in the community. This can have negative consequences on the higher trophic levels that consume them and also creates “dead-zones'' where aerobic species are unable to survive. In this study, pre-treatment water and post-treatment water were sampled and observed for diversity and abundance of diatoms, a quantifiable subphylum of phytoplankton. It was hypothesized that successful treatment would result in higher diversity of diatoms in post-treatment waters than that of pretreatment waters. This study found 30 morphologies across all sample sites, with abundance of 2-4 species being significantly greater in pre-treatment ponds than post-treatment ponds. There were no significant trends in diversity across the ponds.",Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/8
Effects of Fasting on the Oral Microbiome,"Wang, Youyuan ; Moreno, Leonard ; Reyes, Fernando","Humans are mostly made up of microbes. Multiple studies have estimated that bacterial cells outnumber human cells in the body, with our digestive systems harboring the highest concentrations of bacterial life. The oral microbiome is densely populated and of significant physiological importance. These microbial communities maintain tooth and gum health, aids in pre-digestion of foods, and even plays a defensive role — guarding their host from external threats that may lead to oral and systemic pathologies. Studies have shown that fasting can affect the gut microbiome, but there is currently insufficient research on how fasting intervals can affect the oral microbiome. This study will compare the oral microbiome of subjects with similar dietary and oral hygiene habits (n=3) before and after a 24-hour fasting period. If the abundance and diversity of bacteria in the subjects’ mouths change in a consistent and significant manner, then intermittent fasting could play a role in reshaping the oral microbiome and influence human wellbeing.",Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/9
Contrast of Smokeless Tobacco and it's Microbiological Footprint in Users and Non-Users,"Brown, Monayjia ; Robbins, Katie ; McKinney, Elyse ; Snell, Sydney","Smokeless tobacco products such as vapes have gained significant popularity over the last 20 years (7), and it is clear that the effects of these products are primarily unknown. This study examines how the microbial profiles found in smokeless tobacco products, such as vapes, can be used in forensic science. By linking these profiles to their owners, investigators can identify suspects in cases where traditional evidence is lacking. This information could provide valuable assistance in tracking victims and matching perpetrators or victims to crime scenes. Forensic science involves any evidence found at a crime scene that is examined and analyzed to expand on the findings. Forensic science can be defined as applying a range of sciences to criminal and civil laws. Forensic science is crucial in criminal investigation, but it is not known for using microbiology to create a specific biological profile (8). This research could break microbiology into the field of forensic science by using the example of creating microbial footprints to help with other instances in the field. We will analyze the bacteria count in tobacco products and users' microbiomes. Using TSA and Blood agar plates, comparisons between bacteria abundance and diversity in users and non-users will be quantified. We will identify differences in microflora between smokeless tobacco users and non-users. The bacteria produced by users significantly differed from those produced by non-users due to the vapors taken in from the smokeless tobacco product. Vaping growth does not transfer to smokeless tobacco, making it difficult to identify users (2). The microflora on the product can help researchers study its impact on the human microbiome, but forensic profiling is not possible due to the lack of transference from the smokeless tobacco product to the users hands and nose.",oral bacteria ; smokless tobacco ; vapes ; microbiology ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol23/iss1/3

Comparative Analysis of Taproot and Fibrous Root System Microbiomes Under Flooding Stress,"Kozlowski, Natalie S ; Jake, Leighanna","There has been increased interest in understanding how the microbiomes of vascular plants respond to flooding stress and, many studies have focused on monocotyledonous plants with fibrous root systems. This leaves a gap in knowledge of dicotyledonous plants with taproot systems, as previous studies have been in the context of flooding to cropland affecting major food crops which are often monocotyledonous plants with fibrous root systems. Since the structural and functional differences between these root systems may influence microbial community stability and response to flooding conditions, a study looking at both is long overdue As such, this study aims to investigate whether microbial communities associated with taproot systems found in dicotyledonous plants exhibit distinct responses to flooding stress compared to those of previously documented responses of fibrous root systems. To investigate this we cultivated Lolium multiflorum and Brassica rapa, and submitted them to flooding stress taking samples from the roots and rhizosphere in three instances: before flooding, after one day of flooding, and after 3 days of flooding. The results show a statistically significant difference in the richness and species composition of microorganisms between root types. A greater understanding of how the microbial communities of different root structures respond to flooding is key to understanding the agricultural and ecological effects of flooding.",fibrous roots ; Botany ; taproot ; microbiology ; root systems ; Plant Biology ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol24/iss1/2
Elucidating the Relationship Between Water Quality and Antibiotic Resistance of Rainwater Microbes Across Western Humboldt County,"Murphy, Theo P ; Wendley, Eve ; Laskowski, Justice ; Paredes, Tyler","Limited studies have been conducted regarding the fecal contamination and microbial dispersal through rainwater, with no known studies investigating the potential connection between antibiotic resistant microbes and water quality in rainwater. This study seeks to identify the presence of a correlation between water quality and incidence of antibiotic resistance in rainwater microbes. We hypothesize that there will be a correlation between these two variables. We additionally anticipate a high incidence of fecal contamination across rural and urban collection sites alike, with fecal contamination being more prevalent in rural areas than urban locals. To determine water quality, we measured the concentration of fecal coliforms in four rainwater samples collected throughout western Humboldt County using selective and differential media. We determined the levels of antibiotic resistance using microtiter plates and bacterial growth scoring, quantifying antibiotic resistance by calculating the MIC of each isolate across a concentration gradient of ampicillin. We found no relationship between fecal coliform abundance and the incidence of ampicillin resistance. Each sample contained at least one fecal coliform, denoting fecal contamination of rainwater across all collection sites. Therefore, rainwater should not be consumed or used for domestic use without proper filtration and water treatment. With a high concentration of fecal coliforms in our samples, public health may be compromised, as their presence in rainwater indicates the potential for pathogenic microorganisms to disperse via rain events. Further studies elucidating the role of horizontal gene transfer in rain-dispersed microbes is required to fully understand the impacts rainwater has in the geographic distribution of antibiotic resistant microbes in contaminated water.",Environmental Monitoring ; Medical Microbiology ; Chemical and Pharmacologic Phenomena ; rainwater contamination ; fecal coliform ; Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology ; Environmental Public Health ; Environmental Indicators and Impact Assessment ; Bacteriology ; Epidemiology ; water quality ; fecal contamination ; Bacteria ; antibiotic resistance ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol24/iss1/3
Use of Enterococcus faecalis and Cetylpyridinium Chloride in Altering Canine Mouth Microbiome,"Espinola, Quigley D ; Renner, Scarlet ; Cline, Curtis ; Lopez-Orenday, Sophia ; Yasumatsu, Alex","Like most mammals, canines have copious amounts of bacteria in their oral cavity. While some of these bacteria are beneficial and even necessary to their health, overgrowth of harmful bacterial strains can lead to plaque buildup and gum disease. To combat plaque and bacteria, several products are marketed towards canines. In this study, we aim to explore how the microbiome of the canine mouth is affected by a potential probiotic, Enterococcus faecalis, and an antimicrobial water additive found in dog mouthwash products, Cetylpyridinium chloride monohydrate (CCM). We hypothesized that both would be successful in their ability to decrease harmful bacteria. Their relative effectiveness is lacking in literature, however, we expect the CCM to be more effective due to its antimicrobial properties. In this study, we explore this idea by isolating what we believe to be three strains of environmental bacteria based on morphology from a canine's mouth and assessing their ability to grow in nutrient broth containing the probiotic and CCM. We then plated these samples and calculated the original concentration of bacterial growth. We found a significant difference in the abundance of bacteria between the two treatments and the control. CCM inhibited all growth, and Enterococcus faecalis significantly decreased bacterial growth. Both the CCM and Enterococcus faecalis show promising results on adjusting the mouth's microbiome. CCM could potentially harm gut bacteria, making its use in water additives for dogs potentially harmful as it would reach their digestive systems.",Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol24/iss1/4
Growth Trends in Abundance and Diversity of Synthetic Microbial Communities over Varying Thermal Conditions,"Kessler, Mariska M ; Wolfinger, Jocelyn ; Alcaraz, Destiny S","Microorganisms create various communities that act as the foundation of ecosystems. Abiotic factors such as temperature variability and environmental fluctuations are known to produce shifts in the abundance and diversity of microbial communities, but our current understanding is limited. In this study, we aimed to address this gap by observing abundance and diversity growth patterns under different temperature conditions within individual species and communities. Samples of 4 isolates and 4 artificial communities were grown at constant and fluctuating temperatures. Results found that the isolate samples had the highest abundance under constant high temperatures, whereas the community samples had the highest abundance under fluctuating temperatures. The highest diversity was found in the community samples grown in a constant low temperature. These findings suggest that microbial community makeup can be altered by growth temperature. Community samples exhibit the highest growth and diversity under conditions that more closely resemble their natural temperature environment. Researchers should account for this factor when designing experiments with diverse microbial populations.",Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol24/iss1/5
Comparative Analysis of Probiotic Viability in Alcoholic and Non-Alcoholic Kombucha,"Cerrone, Isabella N ; Pirkle, Brooke ; Williamson, Danielle ; Vendrell, Gianna ; Kraft, Chloe","Kombucha is a fermented tea beverage valued for its probiotic and antimicrobial properties that arise from complex molecular interactions between yeast, acetic acid bacteria (AAB), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and metabolic byproducts of fermentation. With the rising demand for non-alcoholic versions of traditionally alcoholic kombucha beverages, ethanol reduction methods have become common, though their impact on probiotic viability and antimicrobial properties remains poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of ethanol removal on kombucha’s functional properties, including probiotic survival, antimicrobial activity, and organic acid composition (pH). We compared alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions of JuneShine kombucha across five flavors. Probiotic viability was assessed through colony-forming units (CFUs) of LAB, AAB, and yeasts on selective media plates. Antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was measured through agar diffusion assays, and organic acid content was analyzed by pH meter readings. Contrary to our hypothesis, probiotic viability was reduced in alcoholic samples, while no significant changes were observed in antimicrobial efficacy or organic acid profiles between the alcoholic and non-alcoholic kombucha variants. These results suggest a need to reevaluate the health claims of alcoholic kombucha and emphasize the importance of scientific validation in functional beverages.",Colony Forming Unites (CFUs) ; Probiotic Viability ; Microbial Viability ; Ethanol Removal ; Food Chemistry ; Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast (SCOBY) ; Food Microbiology ; Fermented Beverages ; Kombucha ; Functional Foods ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol24/iss1/6
Solvent extracts of Pulvigera papillosa (Orthotrichaceae) show no antimicrobial properties in disk diffusion tests,"Solorzano, Ryan A ; Paulin, Justin ; Prater, Grayson ; Lanier, Michael","Abstract As antibiotic-resistant bacteria become more prevalent, the search for novel forms of antibiotics in the natural world has become an increasingly worthwhile endeavor. Many mosses have been found to contain antimicrobial properties, including those in the family Orthotrichaceae. Pulvigera papillosa, an Orthotrichaceous moss native to California, has thus far not been investigated to determine whether it contains antimicrobial properties. Extraction techniques using polar and nonpolar solvents have proven to be effective in extracting the secondary metabolites that allow mosses to defend themselves against a hostile microbial world. This study takes a preliminary look into the antimicrobial properties of P. papillosa using methanol and hexane extractions in conjunction with Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion tests. Evidence for the presence of antimicrobial compounds within the tissues of P. papillosa was not found using our methods. However, our study does not conclusively eliminate P. papillosa as a potential source of antimicrobial compounds.",Moss ; Forest Biology ; Botany ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol24/iss1/7
Assessing Antimicrobial Properties of Plant-derived Ellagic Acid Supplements,"Schuhmann, Noah S ; McLaughlin, Andrew ; Barrera, Julian","Bacteria present in the human gut microbiota are affected by compounds with antimicrobial properties. Phenolic compounds extracted from plants have been shown to exhibit significant antimicrobial capacity at certain concentrations, which makes them an area of interest to researchers. Ellagic acid is one such phenolic compound, present in nuts and berries that many people consume on a regular basis. Supplements containing concentrated ellagic acid provide an additional source for the compound. It is known that, in the body, ellagic acid is metabolized into urolithins, which contribute to health through their anticancer and anti-inflammatory qualities. In this study, we investigated the ability of ellagic acid to inhibit growth of bacteria common in the human gut microbiome and determined the concentrations at which it is most effective in doing so. We found that, despite being polyphenolic, ellagic acid had no visible inhibitory effect on the bacterial species that were tested.",supplement ; ellagic acid ; ellagitannins ; antimicrobial ; Microbiology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjm/vol24/iss1/8
Approaches to Diversity Education  A Critical Assessment,"Brignall, Thomas W, III ; Van Valey, Thomas L","The idea that differences in race, gender, religion, sexuality, age - or other categories deemed unworthy of group inclusion shouldn’t matter when it comes to people’s access to all that a society has to offer is central to the teaching of diversity. Diversity courses can be powerful vehicles, not only for teaching students about social change and reclaiming the principles of past and present civil rights leaders, but also for refuting the notion that we already live in a largely egalitarian society.
This paper examines what a small sample of diversity texts employ with respect to key concepts and definitions. It also makes recommendations for changes and tools to help move the discussion from diversity and tolerance to inclusion and social justice. Lastly, it argues that there is need for specific training for faculty who teach about diversity in order for them to be prepared for some of the critical questions they will be asked by their students.",and Sexuality Studies ; Other Feminist ; critical pedagogy ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; Models and Methods ; Gender ; Gay ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; diversity ; American Politics ; Bisexual ; Comparative Politics ; Political Theory ; Lesbian ; International Relations ; assessment ; Sociology ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/14
Students Promoting Institutional Equity,"Flores, Alicia A.","""Students Promoting Institutional Equity was created in 2016 under the facilitation of Dr. Michelle Cartier's Social Change and Digital Production class in the Film department. The piece is intended to serve as a prequel for future student documentation and activism, juxtaposing HSU as a case study of the larger CSU system, and academia at large. SPIE centers indigeneity, colonialism, resurgence and decolonization as its theoretical lenses and has recently had international attention because of its critical analysis. Alicia Flores was featured as a guest lecturer at the 2017 Ethnic Studies Summit at Chapman University, at which conference they were honored amongst a panel of activists of color, and at which SPIE served its purpose as a platform of discussion. SPIE has also began and continued discussions of institutional violence and indigeneity at San Francisco State University, San Diego State University, Long Beach State University, University of California Berkley, New Mexico State University and University of Waikato, New Zealand, to name a few institutional spaces.""",Film and Media Studies ; and Sexuality Studies ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; Models and Methods ; Gender ; Gay ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; American Politics ; Bisexual ; Comparative Politics ; Political Theory ; Lesbian ; International Relations ; Sociology ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/31
Innovating the Teach-In to Transform the Faculty Findings from a #BlackLivesMatter Teach-In,"Guadalupe-Diaz, Xavier L ; Rincón, Lina ; Rutter, Virginia","College students across the U.S. have been mobilizing their campuses in exposing institutional racism, biases, and curriculum structures that have historically marginalized students of color. As a response to ongoing racial justice movements such as #BlackLivesMatter, we developed a new teach-in model with the aim of creating a transformative experience for faculty and students. Our teach-in challenged faculty to incorporate topics related to #BlackLivesMatter to the discipline-specific content of their course during the same one-week period; this was followed by a campus-wide town hall event. Framed by critical race theory with the goal of creating transformative learning for faculty, we sought to assess the impact of the teach-in from the perspective of teachers. Our findings indicated that our teach-in successfully created an opportunity for faculty to interrogate their curriculum, engage students in race discussions, and develop the knowledge and professional skills needed to tackle a more inclusive social justice curriculum.",Curriculum and Social Inquiry ; Higher Education ; Race and Ethnicity ; Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/15
A Tale of Two Settings Rethinking Methods and Approaches for Diversity Research,"Samura, Michelle","In order to better understand the range of experiences of diverse college students, scholars engaging in diversity research must be mindful of our methodological assumptions. Existing research on environment and space suggests that the concept of a “setting” is not neutral or static. In this article, I emphasize the need to consider campus spaces as dynamic and fluid. I also suggest that depictions and reports of studies’ settings should capture diverse perspectives because different populations can view a single setting very differently. A singular version of a research setting may be inadequate. I offer an example of how one setting can be viewed in very different ways and reported in a way that captures the difference. The disconnects between institutional perceptions of campus space and students’ perceptions of a setting may offer greater insight into how diversity is experienced and understood by different constituents.",Diversity ; Place and Environment ; Race and Ethnicity ; Other Geography ; Higher Education ; College Students ; Research Methodology ; Space,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/9

As we wrote together about our common commitment to EDI, the specifics of our disciplines fell into the background as we focused on four core objectives for teaching EDI: awareness, knowledge, skills, and action. We present promising practices for raising self-awareness, increasing knowledge, developing skills, and inspiring students to action.

The Diversity Challenge for Higher Education in Canada The Prospects and Challenges of Increased Access and Student Success,"Michalski, Joseph H ; Cunningham, Tracy ; Henry, Joe","With the shifting demographics of societies such as the United States and Canada, access to higher education presents a variety of challenges to ensure that universities are able to meet the challenges associated with increased student diversity on campus. The current paper reviews first the literature on the linkages between social inequality and education, before turning to an examination of Canadian data with respect to access issues and the possible barriers to increasing diversity among postsecondary institutions. The evidence reveals that first-generation students and those whose parents did not attend university, Aboriginal peoples, and students with disabilities (among others) continue to be underrepresented in postsecondary education. At the same time, the paper argues that while institutions of higher learning can facilitate improved access, they must commit to developing support services and a more welcoming and inclusive environment in order to ensure student retention and success among an increasingly diverse student population. The paper concludes with a discussion of “best practices” from the perspective of a predominantly undergraduate, liberal arts institution in southern Ontario.",student success ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; access ; higher education ; student services ; diversity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/11
Racial Attitudes of University Faculty Members Does Interracial Contact Matter?,"Gleditsch, Rebecca Folkman ; Berg, Justin Allen","Using primary data from a Midwestern university, this study examines racial attitudes of white faculty members. Contact theory is used to understand the variation in the number of racial minority students that white faculty members advise, independent of individual characteristics and social organizational factors. Findings indicate that white faculty members rate Asian/Asian American college students most favorably overall. In general, faculty then ranked white, African American, Latino, and Native American college students in descending order with respect to a host of characteristics. Finally, supporting contact theory, white faculty members who went to high schools with more racial minorities and who work with more colleagues who are racial minorities are significantly more likely to advise racial minority students. One implication of these outcomes is that greater interracial contact between white faculty members and racial minority colleagues and students is likely to have a positive impact on campus climate race relations.",faculty attitudes ; and Sexuality Studies ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; Models and Methods ; Gender ; Gay ; racial attitudes ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; campus climate ; American Politics ; Bisexual ; race relations ; Comparative Politics ; higher education ; Political Theory ; Lesbian ; International Relations ; Sociology ; contact theory ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/13
Introducing the Invisible Man Black Male Professionals in Higher Education,"Turner, Claudine ; Grauerholz, Liz","The absence of Black male professionals in higher education pose a serious challenge to diversity and social justice in colleges and universities. Not only does this paucity reinforce the dominant racial system within these institutions and contribute to the marginalization and discrimination experienced by these men, the lack of Black men in professional positions has serious implications for the retention and graduation of students of color. Yet, despite their important role, very little research exists about their experiences as professionals within institutions of higher education. This study fills this gap by examining Black men working as faculty, administrative or professional staff at a large research university. We found that: 1) these men felt they did experience racism in their workplace; 2) the lack of other Black men in the professional ranks and the disparate treatment they received made them question both the institution’s commitment to diversity and themselves; and 3) they were resigned to this being the way of life and believed part of their job is to prepare the next generation. The experiences described by our respondents suggest that higher education institutions in the United States reflect the nation’s racialized social structure and the broader society’s exclusion of members of nondominant social groups. We conclude with recommendations for making institutions of higher education more diverse and inclusive for all underrepresented groups.",Black men ; Race and Ethnicity ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; higher education ; Economy and Organizations ; racism ; Women's Studies ; aversive racism ; Sociology ; Work ; diversity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/20
The Burden of Invisible Work in Academia Social Inequalities and Time Use in Five University Departments,University of Oregon Social Sciences Feminist Network Research Interest Group,"Despite an increase in the number of PhDs earned by women and faculty of color in recent decades, they are less numerous among faculty at US colleges and universities. This scarcity is most pronounced at the level of full professor. Why are women and faculty of color not reaching the upper levels of academia? Previous research in the cultural taxation literature suggests that women and faculty of color experience heavier service burdens than their white male colleagues. In order to examine whether a heavier service burden could be at the root of the “leaky pipeline” from PhD to full professor among women and faculty of color, we recruited faculty in five departments at a large research university to record their daily tasks in time-use journals during two different weeks in a 10-week quarter. Our analysis of these journals provided mixed results with regard to gender, but pointed to important differences with regard to other axes of inequality. Specifically, we found that faculty of color, queer faculty, and faculty from working class backgrounds together spent a disproportionate amount of their time on the “invisible” work of academia, leaving them less time for the work that matters for tenure and promotion.",and Sexuality Studies ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; gender ; Models and Methods ; Gender ; Gay ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; American Politics ; Bisexual ; Comparative Politics ; higher education ; Political Theory ; division of labor ; Lesbian ; race ; International Relations ; Sociology ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/21

Equity-Minded High-Impact Learning A Short-Term Approach to Student-Faculty Collaborative Research,"Chepp, Valerie","This article explores the potential for high-impact learning practices—and specifically student-faculty collaborative research—to address inequality in U.S. institutions of higher education. In theory, student-faculty research holds much promise for promoting diversity and social justice in higher education. This high-impact practice reflects ideals around collaboration and mentoring, and offers a more egalitarian approach to the traditional student-faculty power relationship. In practice, however, collaborative research runs the risk of reproducing inequality, thereby undermining its transformative potential. Drawing upon bell hooks’ (1994) notion of radical pedagogy, and in the spirit of being equity-minded, I propose a short-term version of student-faculty collaborative research. This truncated approach is an effort to ameliorate some of the barriers associated with traditional collaborative research, and provides a model for critically assessing how educational “best practices” can reproduce, as well as disrupt, inequality in higher education.",Gender ; and Sexuality Studies ; radical pedagogy ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Other Feminist ; Scholarship of Teaching and Learning ; video pedagogy ; high-impact learning ; Women's Studies ; Higher Education and Teaching ; Sociology ; Politics and Social Change ; student-faculty collaborative research,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/17
The Importance of Faculty Appreciation and Recognition A Case Study of One Institution,"Sahl, Allison","This study examines racial differences in faculty satisfaction with appreciation and recognition at a large university in the western United States.

We found high levels of support among faculty for cultural competency training for students in bench and health sciences broadly, though data suggests that faculty are unsure how to effectively teach cultural competency and how to evaluate its effectiveness. Placing this data alongside literature exploring the lack of diversity and a “chilly climate” in STEM and health science disciplines for marginalized groups, we argue for 1) a need to improve and expand cultural competency training already in place for students and provide faculty with the knowledge and skills to teach it, and 2) using cultural competency as a tool for addressing the lack of diversity and the “culture of no culture” that pervades STEM and health science disciplines.",Gender ; Education ; Lesbian ; Gay ; Bisexual ; and Sexuality Studies ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Other Feminist ; students ; STEM ; faculty ; Higher Education ; Sociology ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; Politics and Social Change ; diversity ; cultural competency,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/12
Color-Blind Contradictions and Black/White Binaries  White Academics Upholding Whiteness,"Brooks-Immel, Demerris R, Ed.D. ; Murray, Susan B, Ph.D.","This qualitative study maps ‘locally situated’ (Twine and Gallagher 2008), contours of whiteness as cultural practice and institutional discourse by examining how white college faculty, staff, and administrators respond to multiracial educational environments and multicultural ideals. Drawing on depth interviews with thirty white administrators, faculty, and staff, this study finds that these white educators adhered to an intermittent form of color-blind racism (Bonilla-Silva, 2009) that enabled them to hold fast to the fiction that race has no meaning in their lives, yet remains the single-most defining dimension of the lives of people of color. This analysis identifies five contextually-embedded manifestations of everyday racism and microconstructions of white supremacy: 1) Whites subscribe to a view of racism as an individualized phenomenon, 2) Whites take a color-blind position regarding race in their daily lives, 3) Whites claim, ‘people of color see race, but I do not,’ 4) Whites employ a diversity discourse of “helping and caring,” 5) Whites see race primarily as a black/white binary.

Beyond Acceptance Serving the Needs of Transgender Students at Women’s Colleges,"Freitas, Annie","The inclusion of transgender students in women’s colleges has been widely debated on campuses and in the media. Despite some opposition, transgender students at women’s colleges are growing in number and visibility. This study examines the ways that transgender students’ experiences differ from the experiences of cisgender students in both single-sex and co-educational environments. Conclusions are based on assessments of support, reported attitudes towards transgender students, and reported knowledge about transgender history and social issues using responses to a survey completed by 184 students at a variety of colleges and universities. The study found significant differences between women’s colleges and co-educational universities such that women’s colleges were rated as more supportive for all students and students at women’s colleges reported significantly more positive attitudes towards transgender students. Additionally, transgender students at women’s colleges reported more positive overall experiences of college, as compared to transgender students at co-educational colleges. Given that the sample was majority white, cisgender, women’s college students, the measures used should be replicated in order to determine the generalizability of these results.",women ; Gender ; Gay ; Lesbian ; Bisexual ; and Sexuality Studies ; transgender ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; higher education ; Other Feminist ; students ; Women's Studies ; American Politics ; Sociology ; and Transgender Studies ; Politics and Social Change,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss39/25

"What it Means to Do Gender Differently Understanding Identity, Perceptions and Accomplishments in a Gendered World","Smith, Joshua S ; Smith, Kristin E","Recent changes in policies, laws, and public opinion have brought discussions about gender and gender-related topics to the forefront of cultural discourse. In spite of increased acceptance of gender nonconformity in public laws and Supreme Court rulings, we continue to see acts of hostility towards people who express their gender in nontraditional ways on both macro-system and individual levels. Viewing questions surrounding the issues of gender through an identity-oriented lens may shed light on some aspects of this complex topic. The present research utilizes social psychological and gender theories in order to better understand and explore the apparent contradictions in the gender discourse. Through the analysis of survey data on gender identity gathered from a university student population, we seek to illuminate the complex interactions that occur between self-meanings, perceptions, and behaviors related to gender identities. Specifically, we analyze: 1) how self-views of gender relate to perceptions of non-conforming gender displays, 2) how self-views relate to doing gender differently and 3) how these variables relate to perceptions of inclusiveness and safety. We find that self-meanings seem to not relate to perceptions or experiences, but that doing gender differently is related to increases in experiences discrimination and aggressions as well as perceptions about safety and inclusion. Implications and future research options are also discussed.",and Sexuality Studies ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; gender performance ; gender ; Models and Methods ; Gender ; Gay ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; gender identity ; doing gender ; American Politics ; Bisexual ; Comparative Politics ; Keywords: Identity ; Political Theory ; Lesbian ; International Relations ; Sociology ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss38/8

Homophobia without Homophobes Deconstructing the Public Discourses of 21st Century Queer Sexualities in the United States,"Teal, Janae ; Conover-Williams, Meredith","In contrast to even a decade ago, there are more queer people in the public eye, and an increasing number people embracing a diverse range of sexual identities in the United States. To be overtly homophobic in public discourse is now risky, with public figures facing increased backlash. At the same time, even after marriage equality has been achieved, queer people in the United States still face systemic barriers to lived equality. We theorize that homophobia, while no longer as overt as it once was, has been rearticulated into covert forms of homophobia and heteronormativity, paralleling the covert racism seen in today’s social structures. While not an empirical study, we provide several examples from public discourse, including television, film, popular music, games, politics and social media to support our theory. Similar to the way Bonilla-Silva (2014) examines “racism without racists,” we contend that heterosexism is maintained through modern forms of homophobia: naturalization, cultural homophobia and the minimization of homophobia.",Gender ; Gay ; Lesbian ; Bisexual ; and Sexuality Studies ; International Relations ; Comparative Politics ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; Political Theory ; American Politics ; Sociology ; and Transgender Studies ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Models and Methods ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss38/5
"Pray Away the Criminal? Crime, Religiosity, Gender and Sexuality Over the Life Course","Conover-Williams, Meredith ; Chang, Joice","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) individuals in the United States seem to be making strides in some social institutions, such as family, due to the recent ruling on marriage equality. Still, there remains a contentious relationship between sexual and gender minority youth, adults, and the institution of religion, for many faith systems. This study explores the relationship between religiosity, long theorized to act as a protective factor from offending, gender and sexuality. We use three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) (Wave I, N = 12,940; Wave III, N = 10,742; Wave IV, N = 8,362) to look at these relationships over three stages of the life course (adolescence, young adulthood, and adulthood) on a particular type of offending: selling drugs. We find that while the effects of high levels of religiosity are protective from selling drugs, the effect is not as strong on sexual minority youth and adults as their sexual majority counterparts. We also find the effects of gender are stronger than sexual minority status, across the life course.",and Sexuality Studies ; Religiosity ; drugs ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; Politics and Social Change ; Models and Methods ; Gender ; Gay ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; American Politics ; life course ; sexual minority ; Bisexual ; Comparative Politics ; Political Theory ; protective factor ; Lesbian ; International Relations ; Sociology ; crime ; Other Political Science ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss38/6
Queer and Trans After Obergefell v.

Equal Rights/Equal Marriage Creating Spaces for Jurisgenerative Praxis,"Onishenko, Dawn","In Canada, particularly since the protection of minority rights under the Charter, rights rhetoric and judicial challenges have emerged as a critical means of redressing the inequity experienced by subordinated peoples and groups - thereby privileging law and its accompanying equality framework as an agent of enfranchisement. Undoubtedly, no other social group has witnessed such rapid advancement of their rights via legal activism in the Canadian policy landscape as has the LGBTQ community – including access to marriage. This paper uses findings from a qualitative study with LGBTQ individuals who married their same -sex partners to increase our understanding of the impact of the Equal Marriage Charter challenge and associated equality discourse as a mechanism for, or moment of, jurisgenerative praxis for LGBTQ people choosing same-sex marriage.",jurisgenerative praxis ; and Sexuality Studies ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; and Transgender Studies ; Models and Methods ; Gender ; Gay ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; equality discourse ; American Politics ; marriage equality ; Bisexual ; Comparative Politics ; Political Theory ; LGBTQ ; Lesbian ; International Relations ; Sociology ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss38/9

Gay Marriage Legal What Now?,"Olmedo, Liza","The zine discusses various issues revolving the LGBTQ community that go beyond the marriage equality narrative. Although not all issues were discussed, it gives the reader a sense of what other issues the LGBTQ community is facing. It is a monumental achievement to be granted the same rights to marry as our heterosexual counterparts, since there are benefits to being married. However, not every queer person wants to be married. As queer people we have to take a step back and be critical of the institution of marriage. The large Marriage Equality narrative, in my opinion, says to non-queers “Hey we want to be married too! We’re not so different from you! We want to be like you too!” but to be queer is to be odd and strange. To be queer is resistance. Resistance against normality, heterosexuality and conventional norms. Within the zine you will find pictures, opinions, rants, critiques, and a poem in regards to the issues that go beyond gay marriage. - Liza Olmedo",Gender ; Gay ; Lesbian ; Bisexual ; and Sexuality Studies ; International Relations ; Comparative Politics ; Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Other Feminist ; Women's Studies ; Political Theory ; American Politics ; Sociology ; and Transgender Studies ; Politics and Social Change ; Other Political Science ; Models and Methods ; Political Science,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hjsr/vol1/iss38/13

Desks are not meant to accommodate larger bodied students and traveling for conferences to enhance the academic experience can sometimes be impossible.

These six hydrologic units (Mad River Slough, Arcata Bay, Eureka Slough, Eureka Bay, Elk River Slough and South Bay) each share a common shoreline and exposure to tidal inundation. In addition to the six hydrologic units there are 24 hydrologic sub-units with shorelines consisting of diked structures. The hydrologic units encompass a tidal inundation footprint for 2.0 meters (6.6 feet) of sea level rise while the sub-units encompass just 1.0 meter of sea level rise (the sub-units begin to merge with increasing levels of sea level rise) (Figure 1), and include three local coastal program jurisdictions.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/1

The vulnerability rating uses combinations of shoreline attributes (cover type and relative elevation to modeled mean monthly maximum high water) to rank a shoreline segment’s vulnerability to erosion and/or overtopping due to extreme tides, storm surges, and future sea level rise. Shoreline segments were given a rating between 2 and 10, 2 being the least vulnerable and 10 being highly vulnerable. Ranking shoreline vulnerability will assist in identifying assets at risk of flooding in the near-term from existing coastal hazards of shoreline erosion or overtopping.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/25

Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the Humboldt Bay Area,"Powers, Sharon","In 2015, Northern Hydrology Associates published ""Humboldt Bay Sea Level Rise, Hydrodynamic Modeling, and Inundation Vulnerability Mapping,"" which includes GIS files mapping various sea level rise scenarios. Featured are scenarios with 1 and 2 meters of sea level rise with 100-year flood events.
A 100-year flood historically has a 1% probability of occurring in any given year but can occur in shorter intervals (for example, the floods of 1955 and 1964). The 100-year flood is a concept used for insurance and land use planning purposes and does not take sea level rise or associated rising groundwater into account. These are floods that do a lot of damage, but nuisance flooding from less extreme events will cause damage, temporary road closures, etc. more frequently as sea level rises.

"Carbon Sequestration in Tidal Salt Marsh Restoration Projects in Northern Humboldt Bay, California","Burke, Mary ; Jacobson, Sandra","We provide here a literature review and methodology for quantifying carbon sequestration associated with the restoration of tidal salt marshes and construction of a proposed living shoreline structure in Humboldt Bay, California. The rate of carbon sequestration can be used by the City of Arcata to quantify the benefits of restored tidal wetlands and for the City’s own carbon balance documentation. This work scope focused on a) gathering and analyzing existing data sets to estimate carbon sequestration in restoring local tidal salt marshes, b) assessing existing carbon sequestration models to quantify carbon sequestration rates; and c) performing a literature search to inform approaches to quantify carbon sequestration and identify key factors that affect rates.
This memo summarizes the results of our review in two sections: Section (1) presents estimates of carbon sequestered for two restoring salt marshes and a proposed Living Shoreline project in Humboldt Bay; Section (2) utilizes the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEMIII) to quantify carbon sequestration rates in evolving tidal salt marshes coordinately with sea level rise scenarios. Further analysis is presented in Appendix 1 with discussion and literature review of factors that may improve predictive power of current carbon sequestration modeling and a summary of published carbon sequestration values; Appendix 2 presents a parameter sensitivity analysis for the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEMIII) to illustrate which parameters exert the most influence on calculated carbon sequestration rates using this model. We conclude that upon restoration of the two tidal salt marshes and proposed living shoreline in Humboldt Bay to mature salt marsh vegetation, approximately 100 metric Tons per year of carbon will be sequestered above current condition.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/36
"Back to the Future Programmatic Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment With Recommendation’s for Fay Slough, Mad River Slough, and Elk River Slough Wildlife Areas","Sullivan, Robert","Humboldt Bay has the highest rate of seal level rise (18.6 inches per century) in California, and because of compaction and subsidence, former tidelands behind dikes surrounding Humboldt Bay are lower in elevation than Humboldt Bay at high tide. In order to adapt to future change in sea level rise, coastal Wildlife Area Managers need to understand vulnerability and risk, because adaptation to sea level rise is a risk management strategy against an uncertain future. The Humboldt Bay Inventory, Mapping, and Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Project and associated data and reports (Laird 2013 and Powell and Laird 2013) provide an excellent and timely opportunity to rank shoreline vulnerability on State Wildlife Areas located along the Northern California shoreline and Humboldt Bay. The Humboldt Bay shoreline vulnerability rating is a quantitative measure of vulnerability, which uses combinations of shoreline attributes to model mean monthly maximum high water (MMMW) to rank the vulnerability of segments of the shoreline to erosion or overtopping due to extreme tides, storm surges, and future sea level rise. A preliminary shoreline vulnerability analysis of three Wildlife Areas along the Northern Coast of California was conducted, which included Fay Slough Wildlife Area (FSWA), Mad River Slough Wildlife Area (MRSWA), and Elk River Wildlife Area (ELKRWA). Breaching or overtopping of the shoreline on Eureka Slough, Mad River Slough, Fay Slough, Elk River, and Elk River Slough has the potential to flood numerous land uses, infrastructure, and natural and agricultural resources, located within the historic (1870) tidal inundation footprint, which predates the current extensive community and agricultural development surround Humboldt Bay. Quantitative assessment of these potential future risks is timely and will greatly assist the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Land Managers to: (1) Identify areas along the boundary of regional Wildlife Areas that are at risk from shoreline breaching, erosion, and overtopping of water control structures; (2) prioritize, plan, and budget for future infrastructural needs and proactively identify solutions to issues in anticipation of potential effects from sea level rise in the short and long term; and (3) assess overall purpose and ability of particular Wildlife Areas to support their: (a) current natural, agricultural, and cultural resource sites; (b) public recreation management goals and objectives; and (c) agency response capacity to anticipated future changes in the landscape of coastal Wildlife Areas resulting from potential sea level rise. Application of Overall Vulnerability criteria to potentially impacted diked shoreline segments based on information presented herein, indicates that ELKRWA had greatest percentage (86.6%, 1,429.6 ft.) of diked shoreline ranked as Highly Vulnerable, followed by FSWA (69.2%, 2,076.9 ft.), and MRSWA (33.0%, 906.1 ft.). The total length of diked shoreline potentially impacted by sea level rise for all three Wildlife Areas together was approximately 5.7 miles (29,840.3 ft.); and the relationship between vulnerability and elevation of diked shoreline segments was significantly (p <0.000) correlated with overall average elevation of all three Wildlife Areas. Additionally, overall Vulnerability of linear segments of diked shoreline was significantly affected by the type of shoreline surface covering. Mad River Slough Wildlife Area had the highest overall percentage of shoreline fortified with concrete and rock (62.2%, 9,435.4 ft.), followed by ELKRWA (0.3%, 9,235.7 ft.), whereas concrete fortifications were lacking at FSWA. Conversely, ELKRWA and FSWA had the greatest percentage of vegetated shoreline (99.3% [9,299 ft.] and 91.5% [11,105.6 ft.], respectively); whereas FSWA had the greatest percentage of exposed shoreline (7.4%, 826.6 ft.). Finally, sea level rise adaptive planning recommendations are presented for Wildlife Areas vulnerable to sea level rise, which include step-by-step recommendations for conducting a: (1) Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Analysis; (2) Risk Assessment; (3) Adaptation Plan; (4) Review of the Adaptation Plan; (5) Implementation of the Adaptation Plan, and (6) Review, Updating, and Monitoring of the plan.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/37

The purpose of the study was to work with public agencies, landowners, scientists, and stakeholders to better understand the specific flood risks to the transportation infrastructure and other critical resources within the study area and to identify viable adaptation measures in the near-term planning horizon (now through mid-century) for the most at-risk locations. A primary focus of the study was to develop a scenario-based planning approach for understanding the range of possible impacts and consequences resulting from tidal and fluvial flood hazards under current conditions and with future sea level rise. This approach included detailed hydraulic analysis and an evaluation of the anticipated response of the coastal landscape to various flooding events. The plan is intended to help advance the collective understanding of flood risks and improve the readiness for implementing effective sea level rise adaptation projects. This plan is a technical resource for ongoing planning and adaptation efforts but is not a decision document and does not represent a commitment to implement the project concepts discussed in the plan.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/38

The Sea Also Rises,Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury,"The public interest in SLR inspired the Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury to investigate why SLR is happening, how damaging its effects will be, and what must be done to adapt to it.
In September 2022, the conclusion of a study conducted by the County’s Planning Department is expected to recommend the collaborative approach that should be pursued to address SLR around Humboldt Bay. It may be as simple as an informal working group or as formal as a newly created regional agency. Whatever recommendation is forthcoming, the Grand Jury recommends it should be established as soon as possible due to timing and cost factors.
All projects planned along California’s coast require permits from regulatory agencies. Depending on the project, multiple permits are often required. These take time (often years) and are a common complaint among planners and project engineers. In addition, SLR mitigation and adaptation projects are extremely costly. Therefore, the Grand Jury recognizes that our locally elected state officials should be asked to help expedite our SLR plans and assist the County in securing funding from all available sources: state, national, and non-profit foundations.
The Grand Jury believes SLR planning needs to be a priority among all elected officials in the County. The County of Humboldt; the cities of Arcata and Eureka; and the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation, and Conservation District should formally state their immediate and continuous support for, and commitment to, SLR mitigation and adaptation efforts.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/41

Carbon choices determine US cities committed to futures below sea level,"Strauss, B H ; Kulp, S ; Levermann, A","Anthropogenic carbon emissions lock in long-term sea-level rise that greatly exceeds projections for this century, posing profound challenges for coastal development and cultural legacies. Analysis based on previously published relationships linking emissions to warming and warming to rise indicates that unabated carbon emissions up to the year 2100 would commit an eventual global sea-level rise of 4.3–9.9 m. Based on detailed topographic and population data, local high tide lines, and regional long-term sea-level commitment for different carbon emissions and ice sheet stability scenarios, we compute the current population living on endangered land at municipal, state, and national levels within the United States. For unabated climate change, we find that land that is home to more than 20 million people is implicated and is widely distributed among different states and coasts. The total area includes 1,185–1,825 municipalities where land that is home to more than half of the current population would be affected, among them at least 21 cities exceeding 100,000 residents. Under aggressive carbon cuts, more than half of these municipalities would avoid this commitment if the West Antarctic Ice Sheet remains stable. Similarly, more than half of the US population-weighted area under threat could be spared. We provide lists of implicated cities and state populations for different emissions scenarios and with and without a certain collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Although past anthropogenic emissions already have caused sea-level commitment that will force coastal cities to adapt, future emissions will determine which areas we can continue to occupy or may have to abandon.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/26
A model integrating longshore and cross-shore processes for predicting long-term shoreline responses to climate change,"Vitousek, S ; Barnard, P L ; Limber, P ; Erikson, L ; Cole, B","We present a shoreline change model for coastal hazard assessment and management planning. The model, CoSMoS-COAST (Coastal One-line Assimilated Simulation Tool), is a transect-based, one-line model that predicts short-term and long-term shoreline response to climate change in the 21st century. The proposed model represents a novel, modular synthesis of process-based models of coastline evolution due to longshore and cross-shore transport by waves and sea level rise. Additionally, the model uses an extended Kalman ﬁlter for data assimilation of historical shoreline positions to improve estimates of model parameters and thereby improve conﬁdence in long-term predictions. We apply CoSMoS-COAST to simulate sandy shoreline evolution along 500 km of coastline in Southern California, which hosts complex mixtures of beach settings variably backed by dunes, bluffs, cliffs, estuaries, river mouths, and urban infrastructure, providing applicability of the model to virtually any coastal setting. Aided by data assimilation, the model is able to reproduce the observed signal of seasonal shoreline change for the hindcast period of 1995–2010, showing excellent agreement between modeled and observed beach states. The skill of the model during the hindcast period improves conﬁdence in the model’s predictive capability when applied to the forecast period (2010–2100) driven by GCM-projected wave and sea level conditions. Predictions of shoreline change with limited human intervention indicate that 31% to 67% of Southern California beaches may become completely eroded by 2100 under sea level rise scenarios of 0.93 to 2.0 m.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/24

"Amplified Impact of Climate Change on Fine-Sediment Delivery to a Subsiding Coast, Humboldt Bay, California","Curtis, Jennifer ; Flint, Lorraine ; Stern, Michelle ; Lewis, Jack ; Klein, Randy","In Humboldt Bay, tectonic subsidence exacerbates sea-level rise (SLR). To build surface elevations and to keep pace with SLR, the sediment demand created by subsidence and SLR must be balanced by an adequate sediment supply. This study used an ensemble of plausible future scenarios to predict potential climate change impacts on suspended-sediment discharge (Qss) from fluvial sources. Streamflow was simulated using a deterministic water-balance model, and Qss was computed using statistical sediment-transport models. Changes relative to a baseline period (1981–2010) were used to assess climate impacts. For local basins that discharge directly to the bay, the ensemble means projected increases in Qss of 27% for the mid-century (2040–2069) and 58% for the end-of-century (2070–2099). For the Eel River, a regional sediment source that discharges sediment-laden plumes to the coastal margin, the ensemble means projected increases in Qss of 53% for the mid-century and 99% for the end-ofcentury. Climate projections of increased precipitation and streamflow produced amplified increases in the regional sediment supply that may partially or wholly mitigate sediment demand caused by the combined effects of subsidence and SLR. This finding has important implications for coastal resiliency. Coastal regions with an increasing sediment supply may be more resilient to SLR. In a broader context, an increasing sediment supply from fluvial sources has global relevance for communities threatened by SLR that are increasingly building resiliency to SLR using sediment-based solutions that include regional sediment management, beneficial reuse strategies, and marsh restoration.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/27
State Agency Sea-Level Rise Action Plan for California,Sea-Level Rise Leadership Team ; Ocean Protection Council,"Numerous state agencies are dedicated to helping California prepare for sea-level rise (SLR). Our vision is to make all of California, including its coastlines, inland areas, and bays and estuaries, resilient to the impacts of SLR, such as flooding, erosion, and habitat degradation and loss. This occurs through thoughtful and coordinated plans and projects aimed to protect and conserve our unique biodiversity, public health and safety, infrastructure, outdoor access, and coastal economy. This must be done through an equitable process, inclusive of all Californians, that prioritizes environmental and climate justice with an emphasis on partnerships with California Native American tribes and supporting vulnerable communities.
In 2020, the California Natural Resources Agency, CalEPA and over 15 departments and agencies developed SLR Principles, to guide unified, effective action toward SLR resilience for California’s coastal communities, ecosystems, and economies. This action is centered on seven principles:   Best Available Science Partnerships Alignment Communications Local Support Coastal Resilience Projects Equity 
Though these Principles create a direction for how to align state actions and decision points around SLR, an actionable path was needed. The Ocean Protection Council (OPC) was charged with working with agency partners to create a statewide, collaborative Action Plan that would carry out these principles. The result is this document, the SLR Action Plan, a five-year plan to make advances toward coastal resilience through comprehensive, coordinated, and collaborative work. The actions in this plan address urgent needs by identifying proposed new and ongoing work that will be leveraged upon in the next five years. This Action Plan includes over 80 trackable actions, covering both a regional and statewide scope. This work plan is the first of its kind, and sets California up for a safe, equitable, and resilient future. The pace of implementation will depend upon the feasibility and availability of resources and competing priorities.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/28

"A summary of water-quality and salt marsh monitoring, Humboldt Bay, California","Curtis, Jennifer A ; Thorne, Karen M ; Freeman, Chase M ; Buffington, Kevin J ; Drexler, Judith Z","This report summarizes data-collection activities associated with the U.S. Geological Survey Humboldt Bay Water-Quality and Salt Marsh Monitoring Project. This work was undertaken to gain a comprehensive understanding ofwater-quality conditions, salt marsh accretion processes, marsh-edge erosion, and soil-carbon storage in Humboldt Bay, California. Multiparameter sondes recorded water temperature, specific conductance, and turbidity at a 15-minute timestep at two U.S. Geological Survey water-quality stations:   Mad River Slough near Arcata, California (U.S. Geological Survey station 405219124085601) and (2) Hookton Slough near Loleta, California (U.S. Geological Survey station 404038124131801).  
At each station, discrete water samples were collected to develop surrogate regression models that were used to compute a continuous time seriesof suspended-sediment concentration from continuously measured turbidity. Data loggers recorded water depth at a 6-minute timestep in the primary tidal channels (Mad River Slough and Hookton Slough) in two adjacent marshes (Mad River marsh and Hookton marsh).
The marsh monitoring network included five study marshes. Three marshes (Mad River, Manila, and Jacoby) are in the northern embayment of Humboldt Bay and two marshes (White and Hookton) are in the southern embayment. Surface deposition and elevation change were measured using deep rod surface elevation tables and feldspar marker horizons.
Sediment characteristics and soil-carbon storage were measured using a total of 10 shallow cores, distributed across 5 study marshes, collected using an Eijkelkamp peat sampler. Rates of marsh edge erosion (2010–19) were quantified in four marshes (Mad River, Manila, Jacoby, and White) by estimating changes in the areal extent of the vegetated marsh plain using repeat aerial imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived elevation data.
During the monitoring period (2016–19), the mean suspended-sediment concentration computed for Hookton Slough (50±20 milligrams per liter [mg/L]) was higher than Mad River Slough (18±7 mg/L). Uncertainty in mean suspended-sediment concentration values is reported using a 90-percent confidence interval.
Across the five study marshes, elevation change (+1.8±0.6 millimeters per year[mm/yr]) and surface deposition (+2.5±0.5 mm/yr) were lower than published values of local sea-level rise (4.9±0.8 mm/yr), and mean carbon density was 0.029±0.005 grams of carbon per cubic centimeter. From 2010 to 2019, marsh edge erosion and soil carbon loss were greatest in low-elevation marshes with the marsh edge characterized by a gentle transition from mudflat to vegetated marsh (herein, ramped edge morphology) and larger wind-wave exposure. Jacoby Creek marsh experienced the greatest edge erosion. In total, marsh edge erosion was responsible for 62.3 metric tons of estuarine soil carbon storage loss across four study marshes.
Salt marshes are an important component of coastal carbon, which is frequently referred to as “blue carbon.” The monitoring data presented in this report provide fundamental information needed to manage blue carbon stocks, assess marsh vulnerability, inform sea-level rise adaptation planning, and build coastal resiliency to climate change.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/31

Civilian Nuclear Waste Disposal,"Holt, Mark","RL33461
Management of civilian radioactive waste has posed difficult issues for Congress since the beginning of the nuclear power industry in the 1950s. Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The United States currently has no permanent disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel or other highly radioactive waste.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository. NWPA requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop such a repository, which would be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted DOE’s repository site studies to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository to NRC on June 3, 2008. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain project, citing excessive water infiltration, earthquakes, volcanoes, human intrusion, and other technical issues",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/49
"Understanding Marsh Elevation and Accretion Processes and Vulnerability to Rising Sea Levels Across Climatic and Geomorphic Gradients in California, USA","Thorne, Karen M. ; Bristow, McKenna L. ; Rankin, Lyndsay L. ; Kovalenko, Katya E. ; Neville, Justine A. ; Freeman, Chase M. ; Guntenspergen, Glenn R.","Tidal marshes build elevations by below- and aboveground organic and mineral soil processes. Marsh elevation and accre- tion data can be used to determine if marshes are keeping pace with sea-level rise. Using a network of 54 deep rod surface elevation tables with paired feldspar marker horizon plots, we tracked elevation and accretion trends across 16 marshes in California, USA. All sites had overall positive gains across years that included severe drought conditions and extreme rain events. Marsh elevation relative to tidal datum (z*) was the key predictor for elevation and accretion rates, with higher change rates at lower z* sites. Marsh sites are clustered into three regional groups (Northern California, San Francisco Bay area, and Southern California), primarily defined by maximum temperature and annual rainfall differences. Elevation, accretion, and shallow subsidence rates were not significantly different between clusters, but their explanatory variables did vary. High- temperature days were a key predictor for elevation, accretion, and shallow subsidence rates in the state-wide analysis and San Francisco Bay regional analysis. The largest elevation gains were observed in the San Francisco Bay-Delta and some of the smallest in Humboldt Bay, with Morro Bay having the lowest accretion rate overall. Central and Southern California marshes were keeping pace or out-pacing sea-level rise, while none of the Humboldt Bay marshes were keeping pace. Marsh surface elevation data can inform management intervention and be a leading indicator for sea-level rise vulnerability. Long- term monitoring across geomorphic settings can help inform management and anticipate marsh change.",Earth Sciences ; Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/50
Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),"This report and accompanying datasets from the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force provide 1) sea level rise scenarios to 2150 by decade that include estimates of vertical land motion and 2) a set of extreme water level probabilities for various heights along the U.S. coastline. These data are available at 1-degree grids along the U.S. coastline and downscaled specifically at NOAA tide-gauge locations. Estimates of flood exposure are assessed using contemporary U.S. coastal flood-severity thresholds for current conditions (e.g., sea levels and infrastructure footprint) and for the next 30 years (out to year 2050), assuming no additional risk reduction measures are enacted.
This effort builds upon the 2017 Task Force report (Sweet et al., 2017). In particular, the set of global mean sea level rise scenarios from that report are updated and downscaled with output directly from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6; IPCC, 2021a), through the efforts of the NASA Sea Level Change Team; updates include adjustments to the temporal trajectories and exceedance probabilities of these scenarios based upon end-of-century global temperatures. As with the 2017 report, these global mean sea level rise scenarios are regionalized for the U.S. coastline. In addition, methodology supporting the U.S. Department of Defense Regional Sea Level (DRSL) database1 (Hall et al., 2016) is adapted for the extreme water level dataset newly developed for this report.
This report will be a key technical input for the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5). These data and information are being incorporated into current and planned agency tools and services, such as NOAA’s Sea Level Rise Viewer and Inundation Dashboard, NASA’s Sea Level Change Portal, and others. Although the intent of this report is not to provide authoritative guidance or design specifications for a specific project, it is intended to help inform Federal agencies, state and local governments, and stakeholders in coastal communities about current and future sea level rise to help contextualize its effects for decision-making purposes.",Oceanography and Atmospheric Sciences and Meteorology ; Environmental Sciences ; Environmental Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/51
U.S. Nuclear Power Plants Weren’t Built for Climate Change,"Flavelle, C ; Lin, J CF","In 2011, after an earthquake and tsunami caused a meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima-Daiichi power plant, Gregory Jaczko, then the chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, had to worry about two things: whether radioactive fallout would harm the U.S. and whether a similar accident could befall an American plant. The answer to the first question turned out to be no. The second question preoccupies him still.
The NRC directed the operators of the 60 or so working U.S. nuclear power plants to evaluate their current flood risk, using the latest weather modeling technology and accounting for the effects of climate change. Companies were told to compare those risks with what their plants, many almost a half-century old, were built to withstand, and, where there was a gap, to explain how they would close it.
That process has revealed a lot of gaps. But Jaczko and others say that the commission’s new leadership, appointed by President Donald Trump, hasn’t done enough to require owners of nuclear power plants to take preventative measures—and that the risks are increasing as climate change worsens.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/53
"Mapping Choices Carbon, Climate, and Rising Seas Our Global Legacy","Strauss, B H ; Kulp, S ; Levermann, A","Carbon emissions causing 4 degrees Celsius of warming (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) — a business-asusual scenario — could lock in enough eventual sea level rise to submerge land currently home to 470 to 760 million people globally. Carbon cuts resulting in the proposed international target of 2 °C warming (3.6 °F) would reduce the rise locked in so that it would threaten areas now occupied by as few as 130 million people. This contrast is one expression of what is at stake in the December 2015 global climate talks in Paris. This report builds closely on a paper first published online in October 2015 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America by the same authors. That research used relationships between cumulative carbon emissions, warming, and the future global sea level rise they lock in to assess implications for the United States and its cities. What distinguishes the current report is its application of sea level projections to global elevation, tidal, population, and administrative boundary data, instead of U.S. data only. Among all nations, this report finds that China has the most to lose from business as usual, with 145 million citizens today on implicated land. China also has the most to gain from limiting warming to 2 °C, which would cut the total to 64 million. Twelve other nations have more than 10 million people living on implicated land under 4 °C warming — India, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Indonesia, Japan, the United States, Philippines, Egypt, Brazil, Thailand, Myanmar, and the Netherlands, in descending order of total threats. A carbon path that limits warming to 2 °C would reduce exposure by more than 10 million in each listed nation except the last two, and by half or more in all listed nations but Viet Nam (still achieving 44% reduction), Brazil (45%) and the Netherlands (13%). Global megacities with the top ten populations in the balance include Shanghai, Hong Kong, Calcutta, Mumbai, Dhaka, Jakarta, and Hanoi. 4 °C warming could lead to submergence of land inhabited by more than half the population of Shanghai, Mumbai and Hanoi, among these. These results are based on median sea level rise projections. They are also based on global elevation data with a tendency to understate exposure. Carbon emissions this century can lock in these projected threats, but the associated sea level rise is expected to play out over a longer period, likely centuries. This report assesses and lists global nations and urban agglomerations at risk by projected total population exposure, percent exposure, and differences in exposure under warming scenarios of 1.5, 2, 3 and 4 °C (2.7, 3.6, 5.4 and 7.2 °F). Results do not account for present or future shoreline defenses, such as levees, that might be built, nor for future population growth, decline or relocation. In conjunction with this report, Climate Central has extended its interactive and embeddable Mapping Choices platform globally (choices.climatecentral.org). Users can now type in any coastal city name or postal code worldwide, and visually compare the potential consequences of different warming or emissions scenarios on a local map. Climate Central is also serving Google Earth layers for visualizing sea levels associated with 2 °C or 4 °C warming in areas with 3-D building data, available here; and offering spreadsheets for download with analytic results for comprehensive lists of global nations and coastal urban agglomerations, available here.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_state/54

"Scenario Planning for Building Coastal Resilience in the Face of Sea Level Rise The Case of Jacobs Avenue, Eureka, CA","McNamee, Kerry ; Wisheropp, Evan ; Weinstein, Christopher ; Nugent, Andrew ; Richmond, Laurie","This article examines issues surrounding flood control measures for the Jacobs Avenue community located in Eureka, California. This area of northern California is experiencing some of the most rapid rates of sea level rise recorded throughout the state. Researchers conducted interviews with stakeholders, developed geospatial analyses, and reviewed policy documents in order to understand the social, environmental, and political context related to sea level rise planning for Jacobs Avenue. From this information we developed a scenario-based set of management options to guide stakeholders in future decision-making regarding the fate of Jacobs Avenue. We explored the potential challenges and benefits of three possible scenarios: no action, levee improvement, and strategic retreat. Our analysis reveals that there are no easy solutions. Lack of funding and lack of a clear political path towards retreat make it extremely difficult for planners to take proactive steps that might ultimately contribute to increased safety, as well as economic and environmental benefits, for flood-vulnerable communities. The scenario framework developed in this paper can be a useful tool for a wide range of coastal communities, in particular those of geographically isolated northern California and southern Oregon.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_student/12

The goal of this project is to provide Humboldt Baykeeper with a report of potential designs, sites, benefits, and stakeholder opinions related to developing a native Olympia oyster and clam garden restoration pilot project on Wigi. This suitability analysis will examine several different locations across the bay and compare the feasibility of (1) an Olympia oyster restoration, (2) an Olympia oyster living shoreline restoration for sea-level rise, and (3) a clam garden restoration. Based on our research, we will provide an analysis of four sites in North Humboldt Bay for various bivalve restoration strategies. The maps in this report display potential sites based on ecological and regulatory parameters for successful bivalve restoration. This potential pilot bivalve restoration project will provide multiple benefits to communities around Wigi, positively affecting bay ecology, sea-level rise mitigation, and Indigenous cultural practices.

Social Science Research to Help Advance Regional Coordination and Collaboration of Sea Level Rise Planning and Adaptation on Humboldt Bay,"Orth-Gordinier, Kristen","Humboldt Bay is experiencing the fastest rate of relative sea level rise in California and is likely to experience severe sea level rise (SLR) flooding within the next two decades. The Humboldt Bay shoreline is owned and governed by a patchwork of entities with different missions and jurisdictions so coordination of SLR planning will be critical because flooding of hydrologic areas from tidal waters can cross political boundaries. The goal of this project was to conduct social science research that can inform and advance the development of regional coordination and collaboration related to SLR in Humboldt Bay. To do this, I utilized a mixed-methods social science research approach of semi structured interviews (n=46), a survey (n=107), and document review to gather information on people’s knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and expectations of SLR planning and adaptation.
The data indicated that coastal professionals on Humboldt Bay agreed that SLR is a near-term issue and acknowledged a need for regional coordination but did not have a clear direction for how to coordinate cross jurisdictional SLR issues. Respondents identified governance challenges to regional SLR planning and adaptation that included a lack of resources, institutional and philosophical differences, and competing priorities. Responses indicated that environmental regulation provided both challenges and opportunities. Behavioral-related challenges and opportunities noted by study participants included leadership, trust, and personal acceptance of SLR as a phenomenon. Responses also suggested that engagement of the public by coastal professionals has been minimal and will need improvement in order to achieve more equitable adaptation strategies. This study contributes to research on the social and policy dimensions of regional planning and coordination for SLR adaptation and helps to inform local, state, and federal government of the challenges faced by coastal California communities.

Sea Level Rise Analysis High-Importance Access Road Protection,"Alvin, Max ; Goodwyn, Taylor ; Johnson, Karly ; Valverde, Pedro","Cal Poly Humboldt Environmental Resources Engineering Senior Capstone.
This report provides an analysis of design alternatives and ultimately a preferred design to ensure the longevity of Highway 101 near Orick, CA which is under threat of sea level rise (SLR). Highway 101 is the main transportation corridor for communities stretching from Arcata to Crescent City, California. Caltrans provided an area of interest along Highway 101 just southwest of Orick, between mile markers 119.58 and 119.92. The project area of interest is illustrated below in Figure ES-1. This stretch of Highway 101 borders low lying pastures and Redwood Creek's historic estuary. The estuary has seen a significant reduction in size and function since the construction of the U.S. Army Corps. of Engineers levee in 1969.
Four alternative designs were developed to study options to protect this stretch of highway from a 100-year storm event in combination with 25-year sea level rise projections, approximately 3-feet. The designs considered are the installation of rock berm protection, restoring the historic Redwood Creek estuary, raising the roadway, and retreating the highway inland to higher elevation. These were compared using the Delphi method which analysed the alternatives based on a number of environmental, economic, and social criteria. The results of the Delphi matrix indicate that the estuary restoration alternative is selected for further analysis. After a discussion with the client, it was determined that a combination of the estuary restoration and raising the roadway alternatives would be preferred. An overview of this preferred design can be seen in Figure ES-1 above.
In order to protect the highway from SLR, the initial area of interest will be extended south to mile marker 119, about a half mile, and the highway will be raised 4-feet. The design for raising this section of highway will result in the widening of the existing road prism, the extension of the three existing culverts, and the replacement of a small bridge that will also be raised 4-feet to act as a wildlife crossing. The estuary restoration consists of a three phase process: During phase one the estuary will be excavated to match historical records and planting of native vegetation. During this phase a concrete box weir that is 6 ft wide, 4 ft deep, and 12 feet in length will be placed within the levee to allow flow into the estuary during higher river flows. Phase two will consist of surveying conducted by wildlife biologists, botanists, geologists, and hydrologists, and phase three will include any hydrological adjustments needed based upon the findings from phase two. Initial costs including the raising of Highway 101 and the restoration of Redwood Creek estuary were estimated at $19,400,000. Maintenance and operation costs for this design were estimated at $5,150,000 for the first five years and $136,000 annually after the first five years.
The proposed design was modelled using HEC RAS to model water flow through the concrete weir constructed connecting Redwood Creek and the estuary. The concrete weir can withstand a peak velocity of 25 ft/s without failure. To measure the viability of the concrete weir, the velocity of the flow through the concrete weir was measured for different SLR severities with the base case design storm of 50% of the 2-year flow, and the 100-year design flow.",Environmental Sciences ; Environmental Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_student/17
Big Lagoon Sea Level Rise,"Cohen, Kyra ; Seeley, Malia ; Helliwell, Dustin ; Wolff, Albert","Cal Poly Humboldt Environmental Resources Engineering Senior Capstone.
The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) is highly concerned sea level rise (SLR), due to climate change and the potential negative impacts on the California transportation system. SLR is especially important for routes constructed at low elevations and those immediately adjacent to the coast where SLR is one of the largest threats to the transportation system along the coast. Rising sea levels are expected to disrupt the daily lives of Californians, specifically the coastal economies, which increases the risk to public safety and contributes to the decline of ecosystems that are vital to the survival of endangered species (State of California 2022).
The team recommends the Bridge Alternative design that consists of three Reinforced Concrete (RC) Box Girder Bridges in the north, middle and south tsunami zones. The south bridge is the largest structure, with four lanes and a length of 3,000 ft. over a portion of the lagoon, compared to the north and middle zone bridges that are both slightly less than 300 ft. long with only two lanes, as shown below in Figure 1-2. Along the coast of northern California, US Highway 101 mostly runs parallel to the coast, as shown in Figure 1-1. North of the town of Trinidad, CA, between post miles (PM) 108.77 to PM 112.54, the highway lies at low elevation and bisects a portion of Big Lagoon. Due to this low elevation, Caltrans has identified the four-mile section as a high-risk area regarding the impacts from SLR. The team was tasked to determine an appropriate design for protecting the stretch of highway along Big Lagoon from the impacts of SLR. Four different alternatives are designed based on the criteria and constraints identified by the client.",Environmental Sciences ; Environmental Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_student/18

Analysis of the Variables Affecting Plant Species Richness in Deserts,"Kallison, Eli R ; Thompson, Ellen ; Keen, Maddison ; Newman, Rusty","There are many hypotheses that attempt to explain patterns of species diversity in different environments. Deserts are a great place to study changes in species richness because they are relatively nutrient bare and exhibit low precipitation. This barebones environment means that slight shifts in climate and geography may lead to clear changes in species richness. We investigate how temperature, precipitation, water and light availability, latitude, elevation and other variables affect plant species richness in 20 deserts.",botany ; ecology ; multiple regression ; biogeography ; Botany ; plants ; R ; deserts ; richness,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/3

"Exploration of Antiviral Effects of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerases 3, 4 and 5 in Arabidopsis.","Kallison, Eli R ; Beric, Aleksandra ; Meyers, Blake","Small RNAs play a number of vital roles in plants, including viral resistance. A particular class of small RNA that regulates plant defense from pathogens, among other functions, is known as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). A key player in the biogenesis pathway of siRNAs are RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases (RDRs). There are six RDR proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana, three of which have well documented roles (RDRs 1, 2 and 6), and three of which have no documented role. Here, we look at the functions of the unstudied RDRs, RDRs 3, 4 and 5, to see whether they affect antiviral resistance.",molecular genetics ; molecular biology ; plant biology ; RNA dependent RNA polymerases ; small RNA ; plant pathology ; Plant Biology ; siRNA,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/4

In this experiment, we compared the percent coverage of algae and shelled organisms within a quadrat surrounding three types of predatory sea stars (Pisaster ochraceus, Dermasterias imbricata, and Lepasterias hexactis) to determine their habitat based on predatory behavior. Our data showed a significant difference in algae and shelled organism coverage between different species of sea star; shelled organism percent coverage was less than algae percent coverage in all species of sea stars. The niche, or role and position a species plays in its environment, of each star ultimately influenced the frequency and diversity of other recorded organisms.",Marine Biology ; arthropod ; intertidal ; asteroids ; Pisaster ochraceus ; algae coverage ; gastropod,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/5
Percolation in Carbon Nanotube Networks,"Grieder, William P ; Gannett, Will ; Saunders, Ruth","Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have become increasingly useful in different applications since they were discovered in 1991 by Sumio Iijima [1]. One of their many useful qualities is their electronic properties [2]. These CNTs, when formed into a network, can be used as transistors [3] or biosensors [4]. Transistors are devices that regulate either current flow or voltage and act as a switch; they are a crucial component of computers. Biosensors detect the presence of biomolecules. Efficient transistors and biosensors already exist; however, they are expensive to manufacture compared to these CNT networks. The ability of the CNT networks to be transistors or biosensors relies on the percolation properties of the networks. As long as these networks percolate, current can pass through the network from a source electrode to a drain electrode, which can then be modulated by an electrical or biological signal to make devices such as transistors useful.",percolation theory ; percolation ; nano networks ; nano ; Physics ; carbon nanotube,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/10

A combination of socio-cultural and biological perspectives is needed to understand this cycle of revictimization and to offer help for sufferers and public health agencies. In order to better understand these issues, I conducted a synthesis of existing scientific research regarding the discrepancies between biological and sociological studies on revictimization. Within my review of sociological research it was revealed that initial trauma and revictimization are clearly understood as a positive feedback loop, with one increasing the other over a victim’s life. In biology, however, this loop has been acknowledged but the study of the recurrence of trauma has not been integrated into these disciplines. In humans, biology and sociology are inseparable; a recognition in these disciplines that a positive feedback loop exists regarding revictimization is key. Recognizing the existence of this biological feedback loop has the potential to mitigate the damage of past, present, and future trauma. With a better understanding of the biological aspects of their recurring trauma, devastated sufferers can be empowered against damaging ideologies, such as biological determinism and victim blaming.",Anthropology ; positive feedback loop ; trauma ; revictimization,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol4/iss1/1

Combined Use of Data From Avian Surveys Along the Pacific Crest Trail With Biodiversity Repositories to Model Habitat Suitability Throughout Northern California,"Pruhsmeier, Holli N ; McGrann, Michael C ; Graham, Jim","Models that describe species distributions are valuable in guiding management decisions. We compared and combined two avian datasets during the 2010 breeding season in northern California, USA. These datasets were a large-scale avian diversity survey from McGrann and Furnas (2016; 2018) and combined data from Biological Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Our objective was to compare the utility of these two datasets, that employ separate field protocols, to model habitat use for the Black-headed Grosbeak, Hairy Woodpecker, and Yellow-rumped Warbler, three common forest birds in our study area that occupy distinctive habitat types. We also tested whether combining the datasets together would create a model with greater generality over the study area and determine if the data will create response curves that explain certain relationships between environmental characteristics and species occurrences. We found that fine-scale data along a single, albeit extensive, transect built models that predicted suitability well for the section of trail, but did not predict occurrences well for areas beyond the trail in two of the three species. We also found that data from Biological Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) did not have the sampling structure required for finer scale modeling and lacked observations in areas that may be critical for sampling, such as fire-impacted areas. By combining these two datasets, we produced models that captured the range of these species throughout the study area, and we created response curves that explained anticipated habitat associations for each species.",BlueSpray ; woodpeckers ; MaxEnt ; habitat suitability modeling ; passerines ; Natural Resources and Conservation,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol5/iss1/3
"Cannabis Tourism and the Community Resident Attitudes in Humboldt County, California","Pachmayer, Ara ; Switzer, Reed ; Reilly, Shawn","Resident attitudes towards cannabis tourism in Humboldt County, California were investigated in this exploratory study. The primary purpose was to understand if the variables used to explain resident attitudes towards tourism would show similar patterns when applied to cannabis tourism. The study included a questionnaire distributed to adult residents of Humboldt County and was conducted between March and August 2017, just prior to recreational cannabis sales beginning in California. Correlations and crosstabs were performed on the data. While personal benefit was found to have an impact on resident attitudes towards cannabis tourism, other variables indicate mixed support which suggests that some variables may behave differently when considering cannabis tourism. Managerial implications are also considered.",resident attitudes ; tourism ; community ; cannabis tourism ; Leisure Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol5/iss1/6
A Clash of Cultures The Struggle of Native Americans to Participate in Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Western Science Under California’s Marine Life Protection Act,"Corbett, John W. ; Maloney, Ruthie A.","This article comprehensively details the culture clash that took place between Native Americans, the North Group Science Panel, and the Science Advisory Team (SAT) involved in the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). In 1999, the California Legislature passed the Marine Life Protection Act to create a statewide, science-driven network of marine reserves along the 1,100 miles of the California coast. The MLPA was meant to protect marine areas from overharvesting, and an initiative was formed to create a state marine reserve system advised by regional science panels. The science panel, a public body, decided that Native Americans science was not credible, they would not be allowed to present papers or be heard, and would be confined to policy statements for consideration by non-scientific entities. This complete denial of Tribal epistemologies is characteristic of settler colonialism.
As a public body, the SAT, contrary to State constitutional provisions, violated public meeting laws. The Tribes did not accept the SAT denial and historically large protests were held. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), modeling, and science by qualified individuals and Ph.D. marine scientists were rejected by the SAT. The SAT Levels of Protection (LOP) model greatly exaggerated take and harvest to levels that are not plausible. They extrapolated data, such as salmon by-catch numbers from another region other than the Klamath Management Zone, with questionable results. Tribal testimony would have noted and corrected SAT model flaws and resulted in more competent science.
The Best Available Science assumptions used by the SAT disregarded recommendations of inclusiveness by the National Science Foundation, which is used by federal agencies. After rejecting Native American anthropological reports, the SAT initiated their own study that violated numerous provisions of the 1974 Human Research Act. This case study demonstrates considerable advantages to SATs by allowing TEK presentations to science advisory bodies, instead of undertaking such studies solely by a SAT. There has never been an apology for the systematic discrimination detailed in this article. We conclude that science, although it has an important role to play in the development of Natural Resource regulations, must be impartial, open to all, and accepting of TEK––including Tribal monitoring results, fishing logs, survey data and modeling. Submitted materials must be judged upon the quality of the work, not the ethnic or racial background of the submitter. Although subsequent California Fish and Game Commission and Department actions to improve Tribal relations have been implemented, these programs do not address the issues raised in this article.",Environmental Monitoring ; Native Americans ; Marine ; Environmental Education ; Other Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; Other Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Statistical Methodology ; MPA ; MLPA ; stakeholder ; science-based management,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest/vol5/iss1/7

A Hypothetical Experiment for The Relationship Between the Menstrual Cycle and FFA Release,"Sanchez, Ricardo ; Grimmitt, Adam","HYPOTHETICAL:  Sex hormones estrogen and progesterone have been hypothesized to impact FFA release. While these two hormones fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle, basal rates of FFA release are similar between menstrual cycle phases.  Specifically, when looking at the early follicular (EF) and mid luteal (ML) phases, there is differences in plasma or intramuscular FFA release. However, the phase in which estrogen is at its highest and progesterone is at its lowest (late follicular [LF]) has been minimally studied. Additionally, the dynamics of FFA release might vary in non-resting conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in FFA release between the three phases.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest2021/20

I found the music to Nogueira's version but I there were two main challenges in playing it on vibraphone: I needed to transpose the piece from E to F and I needed to find a way to express six-note guitar chords with four mallets.

To fill in some of these knowledge gaps we sampled 6 beaches in Humboldt and Del Norte counties from March through September of 2021. Besides abundance, we recorded water temperature, salinity, wave height and sediment grain size. We collected 529 individual fish at the 6 beaches, with an average of 13 fish per angler per hour (range: 0-126). We found no significant differences among beaches or months, or correlations with the environmental variables measured potentially because their densities are influenced by other variables or our sample sizes were too small.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest2022/104

This issue should be addressed for the mental and physical health of this critical workforce and for the patients under their care. Mindful practice, self-care, improving resiliency, and organizational culture change can decrease stress and in turn may reduce incidence of burnout for RNs.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest2023/133

Strategies to Lower Risk in the Management of Acute Aggression,"Gomez, Luz","Acute aggression poses a risk of harm to patients and staff in acute care. On one hand, disparities in the management of aggression are well documented, with factors like race affecting the likelihood of restraint use. However, agitation is also a leading cause of staff injury, with the majority of such injuries occurring during the application of restraints. Using the Model for Evidence-Based Practice Change, this project aims to implement an aggression order set modeled after the Project BETA (Best Practices in the Evaluation and Treatment of Agitation) guidelines. With this approach, duration of restraint application and incidence of staff injury will decrease by 50% over the next year.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest2023/21
Northern Harrier Foraging Modes in Habitats Around Humboldt Bay,"Silva, Collin",Northern harriers are generalist predators known to occupy and forage over a variety of wetland and grassland types in North America.

The History and Development of the Washoe People,"Blair, Caroline","This project is an exploration in the history, development, and reclamation efforts of the Washoe Tribe. This native tribe’s ancestral land centers around Lake Tahoe and therefore spans the border of Nevada and California. The Washoe people have been adversely impacted by colonial and westward expansion, particularly due to the introduction of disease, decimation of resources, and the emergence of the mining industry. The developing relationship between the Washoe people and both state and federal governments could set a precedent for tribes whose ancestral lands cross state borders. In addition, the efforts of the Washoe to reclaim sacred sites that are popular tourist locations could also set a precedent for the Land back movement, a movement which seeks to return indigenous lands to indigenous control. I believe this research will contribute to the discussion of indigenous development projects and sustainable development, which are important topics for American anthropology currently. Through my research, I have learned that the Washoe Tribe currently has a development project intended to create revenue which is centered around the construction of a sawmill in the Tahoe Forest. The Washoe also have additional proposals for land use within each of their established settlements that will incorporate more agricultural practices and conservation efforts. The sawmill project and land use proposals represent efforts by the Washoe people to reestablish their relationship with their ancestral lands and promote their own development.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest2023/11

"""A Feminist Interpretation Of Women's Work With Koloa In The Tongan Community""","'Akolo, Mele'ana K","The San Francisco Bay Area is home to a Tongan community where the Tongan culture has been established.  A major factor establishing Tongan culture is women’s work with koloa.  Koloa are cultural materials used to fulfill customs and traditions specific to Tongan culture, which are under the control of women where they produce, possess, gift, as well as exchange koloa.  Historically, women have governed the koloa tradition as guardians preserving their tradition.  My thesis exploration focused on three main subjects—women, koloa, and feminism.  The point of studying women from a feminist native perspective was to explore their work with koloa through shared lived experiences.  Information about women’s work was developed from interviews, a survey, and observations.  Methodologies such as a feminist native approach, feminist analysis, as well as autoethnography were imperative for developing an understanding of why women’s work is relevant as well as explaining that understanding by forming Tongan and Pacific Islander feminist thought.  The knowledge I developed confronted aspects of previous research by moving away from producing knowledge overly focused on koloa as a form of wealth, the production of koloa, and overlooking women’s contributions through their work.  Realizing women’s work is relevant because it is a resource that can be used to develop cultural knowledge as well as establish culture was a vigilant discovery defending women as respectable, key members of society.  Bringing awareness to their lasting work involved changing from conventional ways of doing research to incorporating new methods to produce information. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest_posters/1000/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest_posters/1
A New Look at Factors Influencing Iron Limitation amongst Phytoplankton off of the California Upwelling Coastline,"Solomon, Jessica R ; Till, Claire P","The worlds upwelling regions bring nutrient rich water to the euphotic zone and make up the most primary productive regions in the ocean. While upwelled water's nitrogen concentration is high, evidence shows the micronutrient iron can be limiting. Low iron concentration will inhibit the biological utilization of nitrogen, and prevent the phytoplankton community from fulfilling its productivity potential. Previous studies suggest that iron concentration is dictated from the upwelling coastline's geology and river input, but the system is more complex. From published documents, samples were selected from California's upwelling coastline that were either iron limited or iron replete. These samples were unable to be explained by the traditional model. Sea surface temperature and altimetry maps were developed displaying the complexity of the upwelling system and the samples' source of iron concentration was determined. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest_posters/1001/thumbnail.jpg",Oceanography ; Environmental Chemistry ; Biogeochemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest_posters/2
Dissolved Trace Metal Concentrations in Seawater,"Hays, Jeremiah ; Rasmussen, Kezia ; Till, Claire P","Many trace metals are essential micronutrients for phytoplankton, and despite their low concentrations in seawater, trace metals can have large impacts on biological processes. Also due to their low concentrations, the measurement of trace metal concentrations requires precise analytical techniques. One common method utilizes expensive instrumentation that we do not have at HSU. In this research project, we adapted published methods to use the Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Flame AA), an instrument in the HSU Chemistry Department. Results show successful adaptation of the method for zinc and manganese.

Nanodiscs Stabilize Anabaena Sensory Rhodopsin for Transcriptional Regulation Studies,"Cox, Maximilian J ; Green, Madelyne ; Castillo, William F ; Andersen, Jessica K ; Massey, Joshua M ; Aguiar, Alexis D ; Cappuccio, Jenny A","Anabaena Sensory Rhodopsin (ASR) is a retinal containing membrane protein from Anabaena nostoc. ASR undergoes an orange-light induced conformational change from an all trans form to a 13-cis form, which is associated with the release of a bound transducer protein ASRT. It is proposed that the ASR/ASRT complex directly controls the transcription of phycocyanin (cpc-gene) and phycoerythrocyanin (pec-gene). In order to study this protein complex, ASR nanolipoprotein particles (nanodiscs) were assembled, which allows both ends of the ASR protein to be studied. These particles will enable the main goal of this research, which is to identify the mechanism of the ASR/ASRT control of transcription. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest_posters/1008/thumbnail.jpg",Other Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ideafest_posters/7

"“Healthy Country, Healthy People”  Aboriginal Embodied Knowledge Systems in Human/Nature Interrelationships","Cameron, Liz","The relationships between humans and nature require interdisciplinary perspectives to develop expanded understandings at this crucial time for the planet and its inhabitants. A poignant step towards improving the global ecological situation--which includes human survival and flourishing--is to reconnect our human/nature relationships. From an Australian Aboriginal standpoint, human-nature connectedness is integrally embedded in the relationship to the natural world that is termed Country. This term not only illustrates geographical boundaries but encompasses the harmony and balance of all living things within a cultural and spiritual context. At the interface of this knowledge, ways of thinking, feeling and being include a relatedness to localised knowledge based on the guiding principles of respect, responsibility and reciprocity to place. These principles ensure a sustainable environment that incorporates a ‘whole of life’ approach to human and nature health and wellbeing. In articulating how a sense of place is critical to psychological health within the human psyche, this paper explores Australian Aboriginal eco-therapeutic approaches surrounding the proverb ‘Healthy Country, Healthy People’ that strengthen our social and emotional connections with the natural world. The article advocates for a re-evaluation of self and our embedded perspectives that we draw from nature through being on Country.",Human Ecology ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Dharug Aboriginal Nation ; Human-nature connection ; Self-awareness ; Community Psychology ; Environmental Studies ; Other Anthropology ; Social and Cultural Anthropology ; Embodied knowing ; Indigenous ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Eco-therapeutic,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol1/iss1/3

Morita Therapy According to Morita Dwelling in the Tension between Hardy and Fragile Life,"LeVine, Peg","At the turn of the last century, Shōma Morita, MD (1874-1938), observed the ways thriving habitats revitalize and sustain humans, other mammals, birds, insects, fish, trees, fungi, and other life. Compatibly, Morita progressed his theory of peripheral consciousness (mushojūshin), which informed his therapeutic ecological habitat and methods. In Morita’s era, scholars and clinicians mulled over diverse hypotheses on consciousness and how consciousness theories (or lack of a theory) influence therapy and places of delivery. Largely by the 1980s, phenomenological inquiry was displaced (if not discredited) by advocates and funders of cognitive science. Therein, consciousness was reframed as awareness in humans and animals that depends on the species neurological substrates.",Morita therapy ; Human Ecology ; Neurasthenia ; Shinkeishitsu ; Cognitive Psychology ; Community Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Place and Environment ; Shōma Morita ; Environmental Public Health ; Medical Humanities ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Zen ; Environmental Studies ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Outdoor Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol1/iss1/5
Environmental Stewardship Promotes a Sense of Place Coral Health Monitoring on Maui,"Brunold-Conesa, Cynthia","Environmental stewardship is an integral aspect of the Montessori curriculum. It usually includes care of the school’s setting (classrooms, grounds, gardens, eating areas, etc.) and, depending on each school’s unique situation, ideally extends into the larger environment in which the school is situated. During the 2014-15 school year, our class of Middle School students at Montessori Hale O Keiki (MHOK) were asked to select community service projects that were directly relevant to environmental and/or ecological issues on Maui. For our students, Coral Watch was the perfect project through which to integrate marine science, environmental stewardship, and community service. Through a downloadable “do-it-yourself” kit, our Middle School divers learned a simple method to “quantify bleaching and monitor coral health” (Coral Watch, 2015) by measuring small fluctuations in the color of healthy coral—key to identifying abnormal changes. Using an underwater slate, our student divers matched the color of a randomly selected coral with the colors on the slate and assigned a corresponding number. Later, back in the classroom, they uploaded this information to an online database where it was analyzed by scientists in Australia for information on coral bleaching and recovery patterns.",Human Ecology ; Coral Watch ; Montessori Experiential Learning ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Community Psychology ; Environmental Stewardship ; Health and Physical Education ; Place-based Education ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Environmental Studies ; Outdoor Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol1/iss1/4
"Medieval Thinking in the 21st Century  Crystal Balls, Black Swans, and Darwin's Finches in the Time of Corona","Conesa, George","Twenty years into the 21st Century, a sizable swath of the world populace thinks, makes decisions, and defines itself in a conflicted and contradictory chimera. Millions of individuals make use of cutting-edge technologies while simultaneously throwing salt over their shoulders and consulting with the local ‘healer’ about any number of illnesses--to caricaturize, a sort of medieval-thinker-tech-savvy orientation. It is here affirmed that the practical consequences of this agentic amalgamation, modes of thinking, and “being in the world” are counterproductive at best and self-defeating at worst, resulting in much uncertainty and leading to, for example, mixed messages in public health approaches and responses with respect to Covid-19. If this was a case of a simple anachronism, a back-to-the-land movement without technology, it would not be disturbing at all. This agentic amalgamation may be important in formulating what it means to be ‘human’ in rapidly changing contemporary societies long after the Coronavirus pandemic slows or stops.",Human Ecology ; Dunning-Kruger Effect ; Agentic Amalgamation ; Medieval History ; Cognitive Psychology ; Agency ; Community Psychology ; History of Philosophy ; Environmental Studies ; Place and Environment ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Epistemology ; Medieval philosophy,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol1/iss1/7

Indigenous Animistic Belief Systems and Integrated Science Perspective on Humans’ Relationship with Nature and the Coronavirus Pandemic,"Garcia, Cesario","This paper explores some perspectives of indigenous animistic belief systems from researchers who have made observations while studying amongst North American tribes. Specifically, it will address indigenous interactions with the natural world and, in particular, their belief that humans are a part of nature. Next, other perspectives, not rooted in Indigenous belief systems, will be discussed that demonstrate how other cultures and individuals across the globe also view humans as a part of nature, including concepts found in Morita Therapy (Morita, 1928), Arne Naess’ (1987) theory of the ‘ecological self’, and nations around the world that are implementing policies that address ecological crises. Furthermore, the paper will address how a conditional love relationship with nature might lead to humans focusing on the ‘good’ aspects of nature while wanting to eradicate the ‘bad,’ such as COVID-19, through necessary, but also short-term solutions.  Finally, long-term solutions based in ecological sciences will be discussed that promote a responsible interconnected relationship with nature in order to prevent, or at least mitigate, the impacts of future epidemics and pandemics.",Human Ecology ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Community Psychology ; Other Anthropology ; Environmental Studies ; Other Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Animism ; Morita Therapy ; Indigenous ; COVID-19 ; Nature ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Coronavirus,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol1/iss1/6

"Carlos Castaneda (1925-1998)  Reading Between His Lines, a Summary Judgment","Fikes, Jay C., PhD","Don Juan is a fictional character. Yaqui in Sonora and Arizona have no history of peyote rituals. These two facts help explain why, by 1975, Castaneda’s followers were seeking shamans comparable to Don Juan among the Huichol of Mexico. In recent years peyote tourists have invaded the sacred land where Huichol venerate the peyote spirit. The rising tide of tourists in that area is rapidly depleting peyote and has stimulated Mexican authorities to incarcerate Huichol peyote hunters (Fikes, 1993; 2013). In the early 1990s Castaneda created a cult, Tensegrity, which taught disciples stylized movements combining “tai chi, modern dance and karate” (Marshall, 2007). He established an inner circle, demanding that his followers sever all family ties or “erase personal history.” He seduced women followers and probably induced several of them to commit suicide (Austin, 2007; Marshall, 2007). Castaneda’s erratic “acting out” and his insistence that followers cut themselves off entirely from everyone essential to perpetuating their identity exemplified harmful practices described by his followers.",Human Ecology ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Community Psychology ; Environmental Public Health ; Medical Humanities ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Environmental Studies ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Outdoor Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol2/iss1/3
“Ichachu” Ontological Diversity for Assembling Common Futures,"Conesa, Kaliana","The present work explores the role of discursive analyses of language as potent elements in networks of discourse and practice. A particular focus is with how language functions in multiple, overlapping registers, and how this affects its ability to motivate and coalesce diverse actors into communities of practice. In particular, usages of sovereignty, food sovereignty, and ontology are explored as a means for understanding the process of cross-cultural eco-social action. Fundamental to these analyses is the precept that registers of language represent an epistemic diversity always operating in collaborations for biocultural sustainability. By “eco-social action,” it is meant any practice, enacted by an individual or community of practitioners, pursuing ecological resilience and social-cultural justice as intertwined mandates.",Human Ecology ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Community Psychology ; Environmental Public Health ; Medical Humanities ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Environmental Studies ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Outdoor Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol2/iss1/5

Anthropocentrism More than Just a Misunderstood Problem,"Kopnina, Helen ; Washington, Haydn ; Taylor, Bron ; Piccolo, John","Anthropocentrism, in its original connotation in environmental ethics, is the belief that value is human-centered and that all other beings are means to human ends. Environmentally-concerned authors have argued that anthropocentrism is ethically wrong and at the root of ecological crises. Some environmental ethicists argue, however, that critics of anthropocentrism are misguided or even misanthropic. They contend: first that criticism of anthropocentrism can be counterproductive and misleading by failing to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate human interests. Second, that humans differ greatly in their environmental impacts, and consequently, addressing human inequalities should be a precondition for environmental protection. Third, since ecosystems constitute the ‘‘life-support system’’ for humans, anthropocentrism can and should be a powerful motivation for environmental protection. Fourth, human self-love is not only natural but helpful as a starting point for loving others, including nonhumans. Herein we analyze such arguments, agreeing with parts of them while advancing four counter-arguments. First, redefining the term anthropocentrism seems to be an attempt to ignore behavior in which humans focus on themselves at the risk of the planet. Second, if addressing human inequalities is a precondition for environmental protection, biodiversity protection will remain out of the scope of ethical consideration for an indefinite period of time. Third, anthropocentric motivations can only make a positive contribution to the environment in situations where humans are conscious of a direct benefit to themselves. Fourth, ‘self-love’ alone is an inadequate basis for environmental concern and action. We also explore the question of agency, shared responsibility, and a fair attribution of blame for our environmental predicaments.",Human Ecology ; Outdoor Education ; Speciesism ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Human chauvinism ; Community Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Environmental Public Health ; Medical Humanities ; Environmental ethics ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Environmental Studies ; Anthropocentrism ; Biodiversity loss,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol3/iss1/4

From a biological perspective, we view humans as one species among many, but in the fables and films we create for children, we often offer an anthropocentric perspective, imbuing non-human animals with human-like characteristics. What are the consequences of these distinctly different perspectives on children’s reasoning about the natural world? Some have argued that children universally begin with an anthropocentric perspective and that acquiring a biological perspective requires a basic conceptual change (Carey, 1985). But recent work reveals that this anthropocentric perspective, evidenced in urban 5-year-olds, is not evident in 3-year-olds (Herrmann et al., 2010). This indicates that the anthropocentric perspective is not an obligatory first step in children’s reasoning about biological phenomena. In the current paper, we introduced a priming manipulation to assess whether 5-year-olds’ reasoning about a novel biological property is influenced by the perspectives they encounter in children’s books. Just before participating in a reasoning task, each child read a book about bears with an experimenter. What varied was whether bears were depicted from an anthropomorphic (Berenstain Bears) or biological perspective (Animal Encyclopedia). The priming had a dramatic effect. Children reading the Berenstain Bears showed the standard anthropocentric reasoning pattern, but those reading the Animal Encyclopedia adopted a biological pattern. This offers evidence that urban 5-year-olds can adopt either a biological or a human-centered stance, depending upon the context. Thus, children’s books and other media are double-edged swords. Media may (inadvertently) support human-centered reasoning in young children, but may also be instrumental in redirecting children’s attention to a biological model.",Human Ecology ; biological reasoning ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Community Psychology ; Environmental Studies ; anthropocentrism ; Environmental Public Health ; Medical Humanities ; cognitive development ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; children’s books ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Outdoor Education ; cultural priming,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol3/iss1/5
"Pseudo-Patriotism, Polemics, and Propaganda European ‘Indianness’ and Contemporary German Populism","Wernitznig, Dagmar","This article highlights and explores new nuances of colonialisms that can be witnessed in German populist politics in conjunction with public discourses about migration and refugeedom. In their xenophobic aversion towards aliens, ultra-nationalist organizations and parties in Germany pervert the colonial trauma of Native American peoples by projecting it onto their own existence. By drawing analogies between their own lives and the plight of Native American expulsion or forceful assimilation since the arrival of the first European settlers, right-wing individuals and groups perceive themselves as a vanishing tribe that is threatened with extinction, caused by Arabic and African newcomers on German soil. This process of incorporating and representing ‘Indianness’ for the sake of ‘racial purity and survival’ can be interpreted as the most recent step in an exceptionally intricate and problematic historiography of physical, cultural, and psychological intrusion of indigenous peoples’ identities and spheres on the North American continent.",Human Ecology ; German populism ; Cognitive Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Community Psychology ; Place and Environment ; Environmental Public Health ; Medical Humanities ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; ” Propaganda ; Environmental Studies ; Pseudo-patriotism ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Outdoor Education ; European “Indianness,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol3/iss1/6

Why We Experience Musical Emotions William Gardiner’s “The Music of Nature” Revisited,"Boero, Daniela L., Dr.","This paper focuses and expands on the ideas of William Gardiner, an amateur musician who was the first to propose that human emotions experienced in music listening might be inspired by “the sounds of nature.” His book has been ignored for almost two centuries. We revisit his hypothesis from an evolutionary psychology approach. This contribution reviews environmental psychology and musical studies which focus on emotional reactions to basic musical cues such as pitch, timbre, and loudness, and also, on animal communication studies. Reported literature confirms the hypothesis that our ancestral soundscape might have shaped, at least in part, the basic emotions that organize our behavioral responses to environmental stimuli.",Human Ecology ; Place and Environment ; music cognition ; Cognitive Psychology ; Community Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Environmental Public Health ; environmental psychology ; evolutionary psychology ; Medical Humanities ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; William Gardiner ; Environmental Studies ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Outdoor Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol4/iss1/4

Ontological Awareness in Food Systems Education,"Dring, Colin C.","We review efforts in Sustainable Food Systems Education and Critical Food Systems Education literature to employ education in ways that seek social and environmental transformation of food systems. Here, we argue that forms of food systems education that are disconnected from awareness of their ontological roots are destined to reproduce the same food systems with the same consequences for life on Earth. This theoretical paper invites discussions that unpack “habits of being” underpinning modern/colonial conceptualizations of food system issues, transformation efforts, and pedagogies. We note the risk of reinscribing, within food systems education, specific onto-epistemological norms and values that are the root of multiple crises facing food systems (separability, global capital, nation-states, humanism). Using the metaphor of the “house that modernity built,” we invite scholars, teachers, learners, and other practitioners to bring explicit attention to how the ontology of Western modernity arises in discourses on food systems and is reproduced through food systems education. We begin by describing this ontological position and its dominance, situating how contemporary transformations in food systems education neglect ontological foundations, and enumerating a set of harms arising from this disavowal. As a beginning, we suggest that fields related to food systems are a compelling place to interrupt a habit of being that denies and disavows even the presence of ontological positions. Food systems educators within postsecondary institutions are entreated to develop their analyses and pedagogical approaches toward a more just and sustainable future that denaturalizes harmful and falsely universalized.",Human Ecology ; western modernity ; Outdoor Education ; epistemology–education ; Cognitive Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Community Psychology ; food systems education ; Place and Environment ; Environmental Public Health ; Medical Humanities ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; ontology ; Environmental Studies ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; food systems transformation,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol4/iss1/5

Proximate and Ultimate Perspectives on Romantic Love,,"Romantic love is a phenomenon of immense interest to the general public as well as to scholars in several disciplines. It is known to be present in almost all human societies and has been studied from a number of perspectives. In this integrative review, we bring together what is known about romantic love using Tinbergen’s “four questions” framework originating from evolutionary biology. Under the first question, related to mechanisms, we show that it is caused by social, psychological mate choice, genetic, neural, and endocrine mechanisms. The mechanisms regulating psychopathology, cognitive biases, and animal models provide further insights into the mechanisms that regulate romantic love. Under the second question, related to development, we show that romantic love exists across the human lifespan in both sexes. We summarize what is known about its development and the internal and external factors that influence it. We consider cross-cultural perspectives and raise the issue of evolutionary mismatch. Under the third question, related to function, we discuss the fitness-relevant benefits and costs of romantic love with reference to mate choice, courtship, sex, and pair-bonding. We outline three possible selective pressures and contend that romantic love is a suite of adaptions and by-products. Under the fourth question, related to phylogeny, we summarize theories of romantic love’s evolutionary history and show that romantic love probably evolved in concert with pair-bonds in our recent ancestors. We describe the mammalian antecedents to romantic love and the contribution of genes and culture to the expression of modern romantic love. We advance four potential scenarios for the evolution of romantic love. We conclude by summarizing what Tinbergen’s four questions tell us, highlighting outstanding questions as avenues of potential future research, and suggesting a novel ethologically informed working definition to accommodate the multi-faceted understanding of romantic love advanced in this review.",romantic love ; phylogeny ; Health Psychology ; Environmental Studies ; Human Ecology ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Community Psychology ; Counseling Psychology ; human mating ; ontogeny ; Behavior and Ethology ; Other Philosophy ; definition ; Medical Humanities ; Tinbergen ; Outdoor Education ; functions ; Environmental Public Health ; mechanisms ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol5/iss1/3
Loving Truly An Epistemic Approach to the Doxastic Norms of Love,,"If you love someone, is it good to believe better of her than epistemic norms allow? The partiality view says that it is: love, on this view, issues norms of belief that clash with epistemic norms. The partiality view is supposedly supported by an analogy between beliefs and actions, by the phenomenology of love, and by the idea that love commits us to the loved one’s good character. I argue that the partiality view is false, and defend what I call the epistemic view. On the epistemic view, love also issues norms of belief. But these say simply (and perhaps surprisingly) that you should adhere to epistemic norms in forming and maintaining beliefs about loved ones. I offer two arguments for the epistemic view. The first appeals to the emotional responses of love, which, when sensitive to what the loved one is really like, can make love great and be morally transformative. The second is a new argument for why caring for a loved one requires true beliefs about him. We see that there may be some boundaries, such as stuffy traditions, that love is right to defy, but that epistemic boundaries are not among them.",Human Ecology ; Place and Environment ; Cognitive Psychology ; Other Philosophy ; Community Psychology ; Environmental Public Health ; Law and Philosophy ; Medical Humanities ; Counseling Psychology ; Health Psychology ; Human Rights Law ; Law ; Environmental Studies ; Alternative and Complementary Medicine ; Outdoor Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/ije/vol5/iss1/4

Poaching Impact on Golden Eagle Abundance on the Navajo Reservation,"Shirley, Antoinette ; Mikesic, David ; Smith, Chad","The Navajo people use eagle feathers in numerous ceremonies ranging from graduations to protection. The process to get eagle feathers legally requires countless paperwork for the US Fish and Wildlife and a wait time of around two to three years. Thus the black market for feathers has grown exponentially (Jenkins 2005). The Navajo Nation Zoo and Botanical Garden has implemented a recent plan in 2012 to release naturally shed feathers from their four captive Golden Eagles to the tribal people with proper permits. This process still requires paperwork, but the time span of filing for a feather and actually receiving one is only two to three months. I hypothesized that this ability to release feathers to its tribal members has decreased the rate of poaching. I worked closely with the Navajo Nation Zoo and Botanical Garden, as well as the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife, organizing and searching through field collected date from the past ten years. We found that while poaching is still increasing it is now doing so at a much slower progression, especially among juvenile birds. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1000/thumbnail.jpg",Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; Biology ; Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1
A Comparative Color Analysis of 49 Bird Species and the Relation of Habitat Factors to Plumage Coloration in a Tropical Forest,"Suarez, Alyssa","Over time, birds develop phenotypic traits, such as plumage coloration, that may allow them to blend in with their environment or simply stand out for various reasons. These traits can be expressed in three pigments: carotenoids, porphyrines, and melanins. These traits can be influenced by a number of factors, such as species diet, habitat, and ecosystems. To explain what environmental factors may have an effect on bird coloration and specific plumage pigmentation, we studied three habitat factors that act as proxies to the quality of environment, and that can affect variation and intensity of plumage coloration in a tropical forest. The three factors: habitat openness, vegetation diversity, and soil quality, were studied at seven forest fragments in Southern Costa Rica. Using a comparative color analysis among numerous bird species, we determined that birds in open habitats were less saturated in order to avoid predation. Birds in areas that had a greater diversity of vegetation had more color variation due to the fact that they were exposed to a larger diversity of ecological niches. Birds that were studied in areas with richer soil had greater color variation as well, due to a healthier ecosystem. Previous studies lack analyses focusing on these particular factors in relation to bird coloration. This study is important to understand the interactions of bird species within their abiotic and biotic environments and how these interactions can influence plumage coloration in a tropical forest, which in turn may translate into greater diversity of animal behaviors.

Using eDNA to detect Pacific lamprey,"Boone, Ely Daniel","The Pacific Lamprey, Entosphenus tridentatus, is one of the most broadly distributed freshwater fish in western North America. The home range of Pacific Lamprey once stretched from Baja Mexico to Alaska. Over the last few decades, their population has declined with a northerly contraction up the coast. There are few management practices dedicated to the Pacific Lamprey compared to other anadromous fish. The habitat of the Pacific Lamprey is thought to be that of larger tributaries and excludes smaller streams. Other research has supported this hypothesis. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a modern detection technique that is more sensitive and has a higher probability of detection than traditional methods. By using eDNA to compare large and small rivers, the modern sampling technique has provided more supporting evidence to the hypothesis that in Northern California, Pacific Lamprey only utilize large tributaries. This knowledge can aid in improved management practices. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1002/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/3
Assessing phenological trends of deciduous trees at Harvard Forest and throughout the northeastern United States,"Saldivar, Jolene A","Phenology is the study of biological activities influenced by seasonal environmental changes. These changes drive ecosystem functions and services and have been found to be influenced by climate change. The methods for documenting phenology have expanded from ground observation to more advanced methods including digital repeat camera and satellite imagery. Additionally, citizen science programs have contributed observations to nationwide databases. I utilized Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) and data provided by the USA National Phenology Network’s (USA-NPN) citizen science project Nature’s Notebook to examine the phenological trends of five deciduous tree species throughout the northeastern United States. I assessed the accuracy of predicting phenological events and the degree to which various abiotic factors influenced phenology. To predict leaf out dates, an accumulated growing degree day (AGDD) model was developed. The model gave an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 25.5% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 12.6%. Canopy position was found to significantly affect the timing of leaf out and leaf fall for trees located at Harvard Forest. Additionally, leaf fall showed less variability than leaf out throughout all USA-NPN sites. Finally, ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD revealed varying degrees of significance for the timing of phenological events for species based on urbanization status. Overall, biotic factors played differing roles in the timing of phenology for all species across all sites. As interest in phenology continues to increase, there is great potential for further integration of scientific and citizen science data to assess trends and predict future changes. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1003/thumbnail.jpg",Biodiversity ; Forest Biology ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/4
Synthesis and Evaluation of a Lead Binding Peptoid,"Alizadeh, Tara ; Cappuccio, Jenny A. ; Cappuccio, Frank E.",Previous research had shown that peptides with the amino acid sequence GGGTNTLSNNGGG have an affinity for binding lead particles in solution. The aim of this project is to prepare a peptoid with binding affinity for lead. Initial results show a 27:1 lead to peptoid binding with an average 14% lead decrease in the presence of 1.31× 10-5 moles of the peptoid. The decrease in the lead concentration found in the solution coupled with the reusability of the  peptoid resin are promising results for peptoid use in lead contaminated water supplies. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1004/thumbnail.jpg,Polymer Chemistry ; Organic Chemistry ; Materials Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/5
Detection of Trace Metals in Seawater The Importance of UV-Oxidation,"Ghaffari, Parisa ; Till, Claire P","According to oceanographic research, trace metals are essential in life of marine phytoplankton, since many trace metals are micronutrients that are essential for biological processes. However, due to extremely low concentrations of trace metals in seawater, it is difficult to measure their concentrations; therefore, specific analysis methods must be performed in order to determine the concentrations of trace metals. One of the techniques, which is required prior to extraction process, is UV-oxidation in which strong organic ligands that chelate trace metals, such as copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co), are destroyed. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1005/thumbnail.jpg",Environmental Chemistry ; Inorganic Chemistry ; Marine Biology ; Analytical Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/7

Construction of Niemann Pick Disease Type C1 HEK293 Cell Model utilizing CRISPR Gene editing,"Valencia, Stephanie ; Kraff, Austin ; Nisson, Haley ; Steele, John W, IV","Niemann Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder
that affects 1:150,000 people. The disease is characterized by cholesterol
accumulation within lysosomes, as well as clinical cognitive decline and
neurodegeneration. These symptoms can be attributed to a mutation in the
NPC1 gene that leads to the interruption of the intracellular cholesterol
transport. Using CRISPR Cas9 technology, the ability to make a cellular
model with inducible CRISPR gene regulation can give researchers
considerable insight into the cellular pathology of Niemann Pick Disease
Type C1 as well as the ability to apply targeted drug therapy and potentially
lead to drug discovery. We hypothesize that by using bioinformatics, a
CRISPR cas9 system, and genome editing we will make a functioning
HEK293 NPC1 cell model with inducible CRISPR gene regulation. To build
this system, we 1) used online bioinformatics tools to build primers, 2) Hifi
Assembly of mCherry coding sequence with pUC19 plasmid, 3) utilized
gene editing technology with the purpose of inserting the mCherry (a
fluorescent protein) coding DNA sequence into the NPC1 gene and 4)
inserted the built sequence into HEK 293 cells via CRISPR transfection.
Preliminary results show a successful build of the DNA sequence insert
containing the mCherry coding sequence which has been confirmed by
restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. Once completed the model will be
tested in the hopes that it will follow the cellular mechanisms that lead to the
NPC1 cholesterol transporter dysfunction. With the cellular model
successfully made, and functionality proven, future work will include testing
the cells for targeted drug therapy. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1007/thumbnail.jpg",Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/8
CRISPR-Induced Overexpression of Huntingtin as a Cellular Model of Huntington's Disease,"Blumenshine, Dixie ; Steele, John","Huntington’s disease (HD) is associated with CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, which encodes the huntingtin protein. HD progressively damages patients’ neurological function and causes eventual death earlier in each generation affected. Age of onset has been associated with the number of CAG repeats found in the HTT gene. Many attributes of the disease-associated mutant repeats in HTT are not yet understood, including how neurons are damaged and the role of normal and mutant huntingtin proteins in modifying neuronal viability. Our central hypothesis is that overexpression of normal huntingtin, with the eventual inhibition of cells’ autophagy pathway or other route of clearance, will lead to a disease-like state. In order to address this hypothesis, we are developing a novel human cell model that will allow us to assess how excess huntingtin is managed and/or cleared by cells, and precisely how cell death occurs upon buildup of huntingtin protein. Overexpression of endogenous HTT gene products will be induced using our stably integrated inducible CRISPR transcriptional activator (dCas9-VP64 fusion) tools, allowing for transient and reversible transcriptional activation of the HTT gene. Using this model as a starting point, it is possible to study the response of human cells following overexpression alone or with modifications to autophagy pathways to reveal how abnormal expression contributes to cell death. Here we report our generation and preliminary characterization of this novel model system for the study of HD, which will eventually be utilized in drug discovery applications for this neurodegenerative disease. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1008/thumbnail.jpg",Neuroscience and Neurobiology ; Cell Biology ; and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities ; Disease Modeling ; Hereditary ; Congenital ; Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience ; Nervous System Diseases,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/9
Lack of Radio-Emission in Quasars with Extremely High Velocity Outflows,"Quintero, Carla Patricia ; Rodriguez Hidalgo, Paola ; Haas, Sean ; Moiz Khatri, Abdul ; Hall, Pat","We investigated whether there is a connection between radio emission and UV/Optical absorption in quasars. We used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 9 (SDSS DR9), which is a public database that includes spectroscopic information of 87,822 quasars. From that, we are working with a subsample of 6,760 quasar spectra looking for outflows at extremely high velocities: outflowing at speeds larger than 10% the speed of light. We selected the brightest quasars and the ones at the right distance from Earth to be able to study the potential presence of these outflows. Our team has developed a python code in order to do this search systematically and has found 45 cases of quasars where the spectra presents extremely high velocity outflows. We will present that we have found a lack of connection between the presence of these extremely high velocity outflows and the quasars showing radio emission radio-loud.

Novel Tests of Gravity Below Fifty Microns,"Hernandez, Nicholas ; Comden, Zane D ; Dunkely, Noah K ; Isachsen, Hilde ; Johnson, Jeremy S ; Martinez, Gabriela D ; Sanchez, Anthony E ; Hoyle, Charles D","Gravity’s relationship to the other fundamental forces is still not well understood. The Standard Model of quantum mechanics describes interactions between the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces, while Einstein’s theory of General Relativity (GR) describes gravity. There is yet to be a theory that unifies inconsistencies between GR and quantum mechanics. Scenarios of String Theory predicting more than three spatial dimensions also predict physical effects of gravity at sub-millimeter levels that could alter the gravitational inverse-square law. The Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP), a central feature of GR, states that all objects are accelerated at the same rate in a gravitational field independent of their composition. A violation of the WEP at any distance scale would be evidence that current models of gravity are incorrect. At the Humboldt State University Gravitational Research Laboratory, an experiment is being developed to observe gravitational interactions below the 50-micron distance scale. The experiment measures the twist of a parallel-plate torsion pendulum as an attractor mass is oscillated within 100 microns of the pendulum, providing time varying gravitational torque on the pendulum. The size and distance dependence of the torque amplitude provide means to determine deviations from accepted models of gravity on untested distance scales. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1010/thumbnail.jpg",Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; Physics,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/11
Synthesis of alkenylthiols and their formation as self-assembled monolayers for use in the laccase-mediated removal of phenolic compounds,"Preciado, Ana","Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is an endocrine disrupting hormone polluting aquatic systems resulting fish feminization. Current methods of remediation fail to remove enough of the pollutant or produce copious amounts of hazardous waste. Our proposed remediation system works by covalently binding EE2 to a self-assembled monolayer surface(SAM) via radical coupling. Via subsequent SAM polymerization our system allows us to quantify the amount of pollutant, unlike current EE2 removal methods. Adhering our synthesized target molecule (A2) to a gold surface created our SAMs. Surface IR verified successful gold SAM synthesis and was used to monitor changes in surface spectra over time in the presence or absence of laccase, phenol (our EE2 proxy), or both materials combined. The degree of SAM polymerization was unclear due to wide variation in initial absorption of the various gold SAMs utilized. Future studies could offer further evidence supporting this radical removal system as a possible EE2 remediation alternative. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1011/thumbnail.jpg",Organic Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/12
Evaluating the Effects of a Fish-Free Diet Versus a Commercial Sturgeon Diet,"Jackson Reed, Jason J, Mr","The use of fish meal and fish oils by aquaculture are the limiting factor for future growth and sustainability of the industry. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a fish-free diet versus a commercial diet by evaluating growth and feed utilization in White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). An 11-week feeding trial was conducted in an aquaponics recirculating system with 1.5-year-old sturgeon. All tanks received the same amount of feed each day (360g) throughout the experiment, corresponding to 0.8% of their initial body weight. Two tanks were fed a commercial sturgeon diet (Skretting) which included fish meal and fish oil, and the other two tanks were fed a fish-free diet (TwoXSea). Fish were tagged to monitor individual growth rate and water quality was monitored weekly. Average daily growth between fish in the fish-free diet were lower than fish being fed Commercial diet. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1012/thumbnail.jpg",Aquaculture and Fisheries,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/13

CRISPR/Cas9 Endogenous Tagging of NPC1 in HEK293t and human iPSCs,"Valencia, Stephanie ; Steele, John W ; Lesch, Benjamin ; Anthoney, Kyle ; Mackie, Ariah","Niemann Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that affects 1:150,000 people. The disease is characterized by cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, as well as clinical cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. These symptoms are associated with mutations in the NPC1 gene that leads to disruption of intracellular cholesterol transport. Our previous studies indicate that neurons from NPC1 patient iPSCs or the NPC1 I1061T mouse model display impaired turnover of damaged mitochondria. We hypothesized that the accumulation of damaged mitochondria in neurons results in premature neuronal death, driving neurodegeneration in NPC1 disease. Our prior studies also indicated that regulation of serotonin signaling or GLP1 receptor activity may improve mitochondrial burden in NPC1 disease. We sought to expand on these findings by developing new cellular models of NPC1 disease, including: endogenously EGFP- or mCherry-tagged NPC1 and isogenic NPC1 knockout lines with or without reporters. We chose to insert the coding DNA sequence for either EGFP or mCherry in the first coding exon, 3’ to the signal sequence. After cloning the left (LHA) and right (RHA) homology arms from genomic DNA surrounding the insertion site, we assembled a donor template with any of the following inserts between the LHA and RHA: (a) mCherry without stop codon; (b) mCherry with stop codon; (c) EGFP without stop codon; (d) EGFP with stop codon. The resulting donor templates produce either mCherry-NPC1 (a) or EGFP-NPC1 (c) fusion proteins or mCherry (b) or EGFP (d) transcriptional reporters without NPC1 gene function. All four sets are capable of functioning as fluorescent reporters of NPC1 gene expression, while only donors a and c are fusion proteins. We employed dual-nickase CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to insert these sequences into HEK293t cells, looked for successful homozygous insertion, and are beginning to use these tools to understand NPC1 gene expression in human cell types. Our future work will employ these tools in human iPSC models from controls or patients to understand allele-specific expression and/or act as isogenic knock outs to study NPC1 gene function in human iPSC-derived neurons. These cells will ultimately be combined with our inducible CRISPR interference or transcriptional activation system for small scale genetic screens and target discovery/validation efforts in our lab. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1015/thumbnail.jpg",Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience ; Nervous System Diseases ; Neuroscience and Neurobiology ; Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/16
"Quantification and Comparison of Microplastic Contents in Wild Mussels and Maricultured Oysters from Humboldt Bay, California Using Enzymatic Digestion Methods","Raemer, Daniel R","This research evaluates the microplastic contents of commercially maricultured Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and wild mussels (Mytilus edulis) from Humboldt Bay (HB), California.  Ten bivalves were collected from each of three different locations in HB: North Bay, Entrance Bay, and South Bay.  Oysters were purchased directly from a commercial oyster farmer who cultivates them in the North Bay. Bivalves were digested with proteolytic enzyme complexes, vacuum filtered, and microplastics were quantified by microscopic examination of filters.  All samples contained microplastics, with plastic fibers being the most abundant items. Significantly different concentrations of microplastic particles (plastic particles/g tissue wet mass) were found between mussels collected from different locations and from the cultured oysters (p = 0.000).  Mussels from North Bay contained the highest average concentration of microplastics (6.29 ± 1.73 items/g) and were significantly different from all other groups.  Microplastic concentrations in Entrance Bay (3.39 ± 1.19 items/g) and South Bay (2.29 ± 1.75 items/g) mussels were intermediate and not significantly different from each other (p = 0.452).  Oysters contained the lowest microplastic concentrations (0.72 ± 0.34 items/g) and were significantly different from North Bay (p = 0.000) and Entrance Bay (p = 0.001) mussels, but not from the South Bay mussels (p = 0.104).  Half of the samples from each location were digested using the enzyme complex Corolase 7089 and the other half were digested with Corolase 8000, both supplied by AB Enzymes Inc.  All samples treated with Corolase 8000 digested completely, whereas some of the samples treated with Corolase 7089 did not achieve complete digestion, suggesting that Corolase 8000 is more efficient for this purpose.  No significant difference in microplastic recovery was found between the two treatments (p=0.253). ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1016/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/17
An Evaluation of Intensive Management Effects on Soil Microbial Biomass and Functional Diversity,"Smith, Colleen Lee","The effects of forest plantation management on soil microbial biomass and functional diversity can often be significant, but little is known about changes over time. We conducted a study to observe the long-term effects of management strategies used in the Southeastern Tree Research and Education Site (SETRES). This well-characterized site is a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stand composed of 4 treatments: control, irrigated, fertilized, and both irrigated and fertilized. Microbial biomass and functional diversity were first measured at this site throughout the early-mid 1990’s where a significant increase in microbial biomass C and N was observed in the fertilized plots while irrigation had no effect. The use of irrigation in this study was subsequently terminated in 2010. Microbial biomass was quantified with the chloroform fumigation extraction technique for total C and N. We used Biolog EcoPlates™ and FF microplates™ to quantify both bacterial and fungal microbial functional diversity, respectively. By reevaluating the effects of these management strategies exactly 20 years later we can assess the long-term effects of fertilization and irrigation in a predominately sandy soil. Carbon source utilization was similar across treatments indicating that fertilization and irrigation did not have long-term impacts on functional diversity. In contrast to the prior study at SETRES, microbial biomass did not differ among treatments. Understanding the soil biological impacts of intensive management in plantation forestry may help us understand long-term nutrient cycling potential. The SETRES site is scheduled for harvest, and future research projects will evaluate the changes to the microbial community. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1017/thumbnail.jpg",Environmental Chemistry ; Environmental Sciences ; Earth Sciences ; Forest Sciences ; Soil Science ; Forest Management ; Environmental Indicators and Impact Assessment ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Forest Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/18
Progress toward regulating the genome of Humulus lupulus L. (hops).,"Pena, Vannia","Primary metabolic compounds synthesized in higher plants follow a complex interconnected web of pathways, such that the regulation of enzymes within these pathways can affect down stream reactions. In order to study the enzymatic pathways of carotenoid production in Humulus lupulus L. (hops), plants were established in vitro by micropropagation of nodal explants. The young shoots of the Cascade variety were cultured on solid agar medium composed of a modified MS11 (Murashigee and Skoog, 1962) medium with plant growth regulators indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and a-napthalene acetic acid (NAA)14. Successful in vitro cultures were selected to study regulation of enzyme phytoene desaturase (PDS). Using mesophilic DNA (27.1 ng/uL) of Cascade hops and primers, we were able to show that the enzyme phytoene desaturase 3 in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPDS3, ac: AT4G14210.1) shares some homology to hops phytoene desaturase (HlPDS, gnl|BL_ORD_ID| 16589).

Examining the role of the ADCY5 point mutation p.R418W on cellular cAMP levels  and how cAMP affects neuronal differentiation of murine stem cells,"Zepeda, Elizabeth ; Robertson, Kiana S","ADCY5-related Dyskinesia is a rare movement disorder, with early onset in childhood and adolescence. Previous studies have linked this disease to various point mutations in the ADCY5 gene; one study has demonstrated two of these mutations cause an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, the molecular basis of this disease phenotype has yet to be fully understood. Our study seeks to characterize the effects of one specific point mutation, p.R418W, on cellular cAMP levels using HEK293T cells, and to determine if increased cAMP levels affect neuronal differentiation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Our initial experiments demonstrated successful differentiation of mESCs into a neuronal lineage, with 1-2% dopaminergic neuron production, detected by Immunocytochemistry (ICC). This preliminary data showed that treatment with 1400 uM cAMP did affect neuronal differentiation.The most striking finding was the presence of contracting neuronal clusters in the treated neurons, versus non-treated. Current experiments include creating a CRISPR model: a HEK293T cell line containing the p.R418W mutation. We have designed the appropriate guide RNA, confirmed a high transfection efficiency of the CRISPR components using fluorescence microscopy, and are currently screening colonies by sequence analysis. Once the mutant cell line is verified, it will be treated with pharmacological agonists to stimulate cAMP production in mutated cells as well as control cells. The amount of cAMP produced in mutated cells versus wild-type will be quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Once we characterize the amount of cAMP produced in the ACDY5 p.R418W 293T cells, we will see if this level of cAMP affects differentiation of mESCs to dopaminergic neurons using our optimized mESC differentiation protocol. This data will not only help us better understand the role of ADCY5 in neuronal development, it will be beneficial to our collaborators, in choosing appropriate drugs for screening of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), collected from ADCY5 patients. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1020/thumbnail.jpg",Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience ; Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/21
Searching for Trends in Atmospheric Compositions of Extrasolar Planets,"Weber, Kassandra A. ; Rodriguez Hidalgo, Paola ; Turk, Adam ; Maloney, Troy ; Kane, Stephen","Since the first exoplanet was discovered decades ago, there has been a rapid evolution of the study of planets found beyond our solar system. A considerable amount of data has been collected on the nearly 3,838 confirmed exoplanets found to date. Recent findings regarding transmission spectroscopy, a method measuring a planet’s upper atmosphere to determine its composition, have been published on a limited number of exoplanets. The aim of our work is to gather existing data on atmospheric planetary composition and search for potential trends in relation to the exoplanets’ orbital and physical properties. Due to their short periods and thicker atmospheres, hot Jupiter type planets have been our first target population. Out of 78 cases with periods shorter than 3 Earth days and radius larger than 1 Rj (Jupiter radius), we found previously-published data on the atmospheres of 15 hot Jupiters. Only 8 cases had an overlapping wavelength range that allowed comparisons: 4800 - 9000 Angstroms, and within that range only one exoplanet shows absorption in their atmospheric data.

Investigating the genetic diversity of immune genes in a non native population of American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus),"Segovia, Luisa N ; Kiemnec-Tyburczy, Karen M","The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a highly invasive species that has successfully colonized different habitats around the world. Our project’s objective was to isolate and characterize the genetic diversity of a rapidly evolving immune gene in an invasive bullfrog population in California’s Sutter National Wildlife Refuge. The level of immune gene genetic variability in a population may help determine how resistant a population is to pathogens and how persistent an invasive population may be over time. Our hypothesis is that our focal population harbors high genetic diversity, consistent with its presence in Northern California for decades. To test our hypothesis, we amplified a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned the alleles from each frog. We then assessed individual heterozygosity, number of alleles in population and genetic diversity of those alleles using standard population genetic metrics. Finally, we compared the genetic diversity within this bullfrog population to that found in other frog populations, including both native and non-native populations. We found that the levels of diversity in our focal population were similar to the levels found in native populations of other species and higher than in native species that have undergone population declines. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1022/thumbnail.jpg",Genetics and Genomics ; Population Biology ; Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/23

Application of the Abel Transform in Galaxy Visualization,"Malekos, Eric","The Vlasov-Poisson (V-P) system is a widely studied mathematical model in galactic dynamics [2]. Until recently solutions to this nonlinear integro-differential system were limited to a few special cases. Lately numerical models have been developed which generate fully self-consistent solutions satisfying the V-P system presented in the next section [1]. These models have enlarged the space of axially symmetric solutions to include toroidal, spindle-like, and disk-like cases and compositions thereof. These new solutions allow us to better understand the abundance of non-spherical galaxy-morphologies we observe in nature. In this work we apply an integral transform, which projects the models’ 3-dimensional representations onto 2-dimensional views. This allows us to better compare numerical solutions to observations of galaxies as they would appear when viewed edge-on through a telescope. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1024/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/25
Photodegradation of Chlorinated Organic Compounds in Surface Waters,"Tusei, Cristina L ; DiMento, Brian ; Aeppli, Christoph","Chlorinated organic compounds are produced in large quantities and used in industrial products as pesticides and solvents. They leach into aquatic environments and pose a health risk to aquatic organisms and humans due to lengthy residence times and slow biodegradation. However, sunlight has the potential to photodegrade these compounds and abstract chlorine atoms through the reaction with hydrated electrons (eaq-)  and hydroxyl radicals (∙OH). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in natural waters forms eaq- and ∙OH when exposed to sunlight and may facilitate photodegradation. While much research has been conducted on ∙OH, not much is known about the importance of eaq- in the degradation of chlorinated compounds in surface waters.
The research presented here explores the effects eaq- and ∙OH have on the photodegradation of a mixture of six chlorinated compounds in deionized and seawater matrices irradiated by simulated sunlight.
The results from these experiments suggest that hydrated electrons play a greater role in facilitating photodegradation of highly chlorinated compounds than do hydroxyl radicals. A clear depletion in four out of six chlorinated compounds was observed in irradiated samples in deionized water and with a source of eaq- . Although it cannot be said the results are statistically significant, a clear pattern is established. Initial experiments performed with natural seawater were not yet able to clearly identify the effects of  and further experiments must be conducted to understand the role DOM plays in photodegradation.
These results may be used for future reference in studying the fate of chlorinated organic compounds. By understanding the characteristics of free radicals produced by DOM, it is possible to predict the degradation rate of harmful chlorinated compounds in natural waters. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1025/thumbnail.jpg",Oceanography ; Environmental Chemistry ; Organic Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/26

Using Sleeping Beauty Transposon-mediated mutagenesis to drive the evolution of fluid shear stress resistance in a pancreatic cancer cell population,"Pope, Amanda N ; Stipp, Dr. Christopher ; Moose, Devon ; Henry, Dr. Michael ; Dupuy, Dr. Adam","The majority of cancer-related deaths occur as a result of metastasis of tumor cells from the site of the primary tumor to distant locations. During metastasis, tumor cells penetrate from connective tissue into the circulatory system, where they are subjected to mechanical stress due to high velocity blood flow (fluid shear stress, FSS). For metastatic tumors to form, tumor cells must survive FSS, exit circulation, and successfully colonize new locations. It had been assumed that the majority of tumor cells are eliminated by mechanical damage due to FSS, but some recent studies have revealed that many tumor cell types are able to activate signaling pathways that enable them to rapidly adapt to FSS1. Understanding the mechanisms of tumor cell resistance to FSS might enable new therapeutic strategies to disrupt the metastatic process by blocking the ability of metastatic tumor cells to survive FSS-induced mechanical damage. Because most but not all tumor cell lines examined display resistance to FSS2, we hypothesize that resistance to FSS is due to genetically selectable differences in signaling pathways that are activated in cells with intrinsic FSS resistance compared to FSS-sensitive cells. Here we will begin to test our hypothesis using MiaPaca pancreatic cancer cells, one of the rare tumor cell types we have encountered which lacks FSS resistance. We hypothesize that FSS-resistance can be reactivated in MiaPaca cells by mutagenesis followed by selection for FSS-resistant cells. To mutagenize MiaPaca cells and test our hypothesis, we have used the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. The system has two parts: the Sleeping Beauty transposase (SB) and a mutagenic transposon called pT2-Onc3. SB mediates the insertion of pT2-Onc3 at any TA-dinucleotide site in the genome (Fig.1). The pT2-Onc3 transposon can switch genes on or off, depending on where is inserted in the genome. It contains a strong promoter to drive gene expression, as well as spice donor and acceptor sequences that can disrupt gene expression or promote expression of truncated proteins (2). ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1027/thumbnail.jpg",Cancer Biology ; Molecular Biology ; Cell Biology ; Biophysics,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/27
Design of Possible Organic Photovoltaic Compounds and their Initial Computational  Assessment,"Ochoa Castillo, Albert ; Smith, Joshua R","The excessive use of fossil fuels has surged the need for alternative energy sources, such as solar energy. Here, possible organic photovoltaic (OPV) compounds were designed and their initial computational assessment was done. OPV compounds are carbon-based and use organic electronics as a semiconductor to produce electricity from the sun. There is a large interest in OPV cells because they are strong absorbers and come at a low cost of synthesis. In addition, OPV cells can potentially be an alternative to silicon solar cells. As silicon solar cells are often difficult to recycle after they are retired and leave a large carbon footprint after production. Density Functional Theory was used to calculate the HOMO-LUMO gap of the 26 compounds designed. Finding the HOMO-LUMO gap is an important parameter that helps determine the electrical properties of a material. Semiconductors such as naphthalene, 1,1’-biphenyl, and ɑ-septithiophene were used as the backbone. The main electron-withdrawing group (EWG) used here is thieno[3,4-c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole, among other thieno-thiadiazole derivatives. Seven of the 26 compounds demonstrated adequate results and four of them will be further pursued in an attempt to synthesize. Lastly, results suggest there is most likely a correlation between the amount of EWGs attached to the semiconductor and its calculated efficiency. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1028/thumbnail.jpg",Organic Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/29
Forecasting Dissolved Oxygen as a Function of Atmospheric Pressure,"Ceja, Pricilla","The Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI), in collaboration with the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), has conducted a forecast challenge to grow the field of ecological forecasting by using data collected by NEON and weather forecasts made by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We contributed to the challenge by forecasting dissolved oxygen (DO) using atmospheric pressure in a state space framework at an aquatic NEON site, Lake Barco in Florida. Utilizing Bayes Theorem allows for the uncertainties to be quantified and partitioned into different sources of error and process variability, and then allows us to propagate them into the forecast. By utilizing the positive correlation between DO and atmospheric pressure, we hypothesized DO concentrations to be higher along with higher levels of atmospheric pressure because water is able to hold more DO at higher atmospheric pressures due to gas saturation decreasing. The results of this project contribute to the EFI-NEON goal of understanding aquatic systems by showing how a covariate of atmospheric pressure contributes to and affects ecological forecasts of concentration levels of DO. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1029/thumbnail.jpg",Other Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Life Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/30

The Sea Also Rises,Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury,"The public interest in SLR inspired the Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury to investigate why SLR is happening, how damaging its effects will be, and what must be done to adapt to it.
In September 2022, the conclusion of a study conducted by the County’s Planning Department is expected to recommend the collaborative approach that should be pursued to address SLR around Humboldt Bay. It may be as simple as an informal working group or as formal as a newly created regional agency. Whatever recommendation is forthcoming, the Grand Jury recommends it should be established as soon as possible due to timing and cost factors.
All projects planned along California’s coast require permits from regulatory agencies. Depending on the project, multiple permits are often required. These take time (often years) and are a common complaint among planners and project engineers. In addition, SLR mitigation and adaptation projects are extremely costly. Therefore, the Grand Jury recognizes that our locally elected state officials should be asked to help expedite our SLR plans and assist the County in securing funding from all available sources: state, national, and non-profit foundations.
The Grand Jury believes SLR planning needs to be a priority among all elected officials in the County. The County of Humboldt; the cities of Arcata and Eureka; and the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation, and Conservation District should formally state their immediate and continuous support for, and commitment to, SLR mitigation and adaptation efforts.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/isfsi_local/12

Civilian Nuclear Waste Disposal,"Holt, Mark","RL33461
Management of civilian radioactive waste has posed difficult issues for Congress since the beginning of the nuclear power industry in the 1950s. Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The United States currently has no permanent disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel or other highly radioactive waste.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository. NWPA requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop such a repository, which would be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted DOE’s repository site studies to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository to NRC on June 3, 2008. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain project, citing excessive water infiltration, earthquakes, volcanoes, human intrusion, and other technical issues",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/isfsi_state/21

Potential sea level rise impacts these communities could be exposed to include: shoreline erosion, tidal inundation, flooding from rising groundwater in response to sea level rise, backwater flooding during stormwater runoff and high tides, and salt water intrusion of individual septic/wastewater systems.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/isfsi_local/10

The Sea Also Rises,Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury,"The public interest in SLR inspired the Humboldt County Civil Grand Jury to investigate why SLR is happening, how damaging its effects will be, and what must be done to adapt to it.
In September 2022, the conclusion of a study conducted by the County’s Planning Department is expected to recommend the collaborative approach that should be pursued to address SLR around Humboldt Bay. It may be as simple as an informal working group or as formal as a newly created regional agency. Whatever recommendation is forthcoming, the Grand Jury recommends it should be established as soon as possible due to timing and cost factors.
All projects planned along California’s coast require permits from regulatory agencies. Depending on the project, multiple permits are often required. These take time (often years) and are a common complaint among planners and project engineers. In addition, SLR mitigation and adaptation projects are extremely costly. Therefore, the Grand Jury recognizes that our locally elected state officials should be asked to help expedite our SLR plans and assist the County in securing funding from all available sources: state, national, and non-profit foundations.
The Grand Jury believes SLR planning needs to be a priority among all elected officials in the County. The County of Humboldt; the cities of Arcata and Eureka; and the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation, and Conservation District should formally state their immediate and continuous support for, and commitment to, SLR mitigation and adaptation efforts.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/isfsi_local/12

Civilian Nuclear Waste Disposal,"Holt, Mark","RL33461
Management of civilian radioactive waste has posed difficult issues for Congress since the beginning of the nuclear power industry in the 1950s. Federal policy is based on the premise that nuclear waste can be disposed of safely, but proposed storage and disposal facilities have frequently been challenged on safety, health, and environmental grounds. Although civilian radioactive waste encompasses a wide range of materials, most of the current debate focuses on highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants. The United States currently has no permanent disposal facility for spent nuclear fuel or other highly radioactive waste.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) calls for disposal of spent nuclear fuel in a deep geologic repository. NWPA requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop such a repository, which would be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Amendments to NWPA in 1987 restricted DOE’s repository site studies to Yucca Mountain in Nevada. DOE submitted a license application for the proposed Yucca Mountain repository to NRC on June 3, 2008. The State of Nevada strongly opposes the Yucca Mountain project, citing excessive water infiltration, earthquakes, volcanoes, human intrusion, and other technical issues",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/isfsi_state/21

Make Your Escape Experiences with Gamified Library Programming,"Miller, Tim ; Stelter, Kimberly ; Purchio, Garrett ; Hagen, Brianne N","To increase student engagement, the Humboldt State University Library ventured into the realm of gamified programming, exploring several strategies with the goal of trans- forming library outreach and instruction. Our efforts range from simple outreach to highly structured information literacy instruction and workshops that use gamification to encourage students to engage with knowledge practices and dispositions outlined in the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. Using gamified activities in library instruction led us to create lesson plans that are purely game-based, including escape room drop-in sessions where students race against the clock to solve a series of puzzles in order to “escape” the room. This model aimed to promote collaboration and problem-solving skills through inquiry-based learning.",Information Literacy ; Escape Rooms ; Gamification ; Games ; Libraries ; Library and Information Science ; Framework,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/librarian/1

Integrating Campus Partners Towards Equitable Open Educational Resources Adoption A Case Study of a California State University Affordable Learning Solutions Program at Humboldt State University,"Stelter, Kimberly ; Morgan, Kyle ; Barker, Morgan","The Humboldt State University (HSU) Library and HSU Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) collaborated with the campus’ own Accessibility Resource Center, Student Disability Resources Center, and Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion through five training sessions, to facilitate the integration of open educational resources (OER) into the classroom. Faculty and students, from disparate disciplines, participated as equal stakeholders in the discovery and implementation of OER into a course, throughout a year-long immersive program.
This summary covers the history of the California State University (CSU) Affordable Learning Solutions (AL$) OER program at Humboldt State University; the structure of the 2019-2020 implementation of the program; and the results and conclusion to gauge the efficacy of our collective goal to reduce the material costs for students and expand open, equitable, and accessible practices into the classroom. This summary will specifically address the process of integrating inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility into OER adoption and curriculum design, for the purpose of advancing student success. The trainings for the CSU/AL$/OER program are publicly available through our OER Canvas Commons course and our collected OER resources, organized by discipline, are available through our OER Research Guide",Equity ; Open educational resources ; Accessibility ; Higher Education ; Interactivity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/librarian/2
Affordable Learning Engagement and Publishing Strategies Empowering Opportunities for Open-Access Publishing,"Morgan, Kyle","As shown by a current $1.4 trillion in student loan debt (Experian, 2017), the affordability of a college education is one of the most crucial needs for students and the future of higher education. An increasing amount of that debt comes from textbook costs, which rose 812% from 1977 to 2012 (Perry, 2012). Studies by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund and the Student PIRGs (Senack, 2014), the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) Textbook Affordability Workgroup of Oregon (2015), Florida Virtual Campus (2016), and VitalSource Technologies (2017) have reported the deleterious effects on student success when students are not able to buy required textbooks.
Humboldt State University (HSU) Library has worked to address this issue by encouraging the replacement of commercially produced textbooks with open educational resources (OERs). The UNESCO website (2017) defines OERs as follows:
Open Educational Resources (OERs) are any type of educational materials that are in the public domain or introduced with an open license. The nature of these open materials means that anyone can legally and freely copy, use, adapt and re-share them. OERs range from textbooks to curricula, syllabi, lecture notes, assignments, tests, projects, audio, video and animation.
As part of this campaign, HSU Press has encouraged faculty and lecturers to develop their own OER textbooks to address gaps in current OER offerings. This chapter describes the efforts of Humboldt State University Press to develop OER textbooks, including:
A grant project to directly incentivize authors to publish open-access textbooks.   Collaboration in a grant project to incentivize faculty and lecturers to attend OER adoption seminars. Collaboration in a grant project to incentivize departments to redesign their courses and adopt OERs. Collaborations with faculty to publish student-authored open-access works. 
This chapter addresses the benefits and drawbacks of each effort as they pertain to our university, including the use of incentives and publishing as a transformational pedagogical tool. It also discusses the challenge of maintaining OER production, and the value of adopting a broader open access publishing model. In the context of HSU Press, open access refers to content—including educational material, scholarship, research, and creative works—that has been made available for free download and re-use under a Creative Commons license.
Publishing through open access supports the mission of libraries to facilitate the equitable dissemination of knowledge to all people. Open access publishing services also support the HSU campus community by creating and empowering campus authors, providing experiential learning opportunities, developing community outreach, and facilitating the university’s social justice mission. These successes not only justify the services of an open-access press, but allow for continued OER conversations and development on campus.",Higher Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/librarian/4

"The Discovery Adhocracy Special Collections, Information Resource Management, and Scholarly Communications Departments Partnership","Godlin, Sarah ; Hagen, Brianne N ; Marino, Carly ; Morgan, Kyle","The paper will explore how the library’s Special Collections, Information Resource Management, and Scholarly Communications departments are partnering to facilitate campus community publications and digital assets, while centering student voices. We will describe the roles of each department involved in the partnership and provide two case studies of how the partnership works in application. One of the case study publications, Toyon: Seven Decades of Student Driven Publishing, gave students the opportunity to work in research and writing teams to create an open-access book. These professional, paid positions provided experience for students to connect with alumni, conduct research in the archive, author a book, and design the layout. Two of the hired students took their experience with them into publishing-related, full-time positions within the university. The other case study publication, The North Coast Otters and Public Arts Initiative, connected the library’s digital archive with the publication to provide users with multiple images for each piece of artwork. Both works demonstrate the power of using discovery principles to engage readers with both publications and the archive, and are models for future publication and digital asset projects. The collaborations among the three library departments began informally, but coalesced over time into a regularly scheduled working group to address projects involving the entire scholarship cycle from research to authoring to publication to discovery. Besides providing students with opportunities to develop their resumes, the published products capture the history of the university, build connections between the library and the campus, and promote the university and library to the broader community.",Adhocracy ; Scholarly Communications ; Discovery ; Library and Information Science ; Archives ; Metadata ; Special Collections,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/librarian/7

The Extraordinary Voyage of Kamome; A Tsunami Boat Comes Home,"Dengler, Lori ; Miller, Amya ; Uyeki, Amy","This sweet story, intended for lower elementary grades, is intended to provide a window for discussing earthquakes, tsunamis, marine debris, preparedness and cultural awareness in the classroom and within families.
On April 7, 2013, a little over two years after the magnitude 9 Tohoku-oki Japan earthquake triggered a massive tsunami off the coast of northeastern Japan, a lone boat washed up on the shores of Crescent City, California. The confirmation of the boat as belonging to a high school in Rikuzentakata was first step in an amazing story that has linked two tsunami-vulnerable communities on opposite sides of the Pacific and initiated friendships between high school students in Rikuzentakata. This story is now told in a children’s book to be released by Humboldt State University Press in November, 2015. Co-authored by Humboldt State University Emeritus Geology Professor Lori Dengler and Amya Miller, the Director of Global Public Relations in Rikuzentakata, the book features illustrations by Arcata artist Amy Uyeki. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1000/thumbnail.jpg",Oceanography ; Cultural Exchange ; Japan ; Tectonics and Structure ; Bilingual ; and Multicultural Education ; Tsunamis ; Multilingual ; Earthquakes ; Juvenile non-fiction,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1
African Masks from the Collection of James Gaasch,"Gaasch, James","African Masks from the Collection of James Gaasch contains photographs of the African masks and carvers from the Bwa (or Bwaba), Winiama and Mossi peoples of Burkina Faso, and the Bamana and Dogon peoples of Mali. Gaasch acquired many of these masks in the villages where they were carved. When possible, he interviewed the village carvers, the creators, of these dancing masks. Gaasch’s interviews with the carvers underscore the cultural context where traditional African world views persist. And, to the extent possible, they give voice to the masks to reveal their own significance. “They are, in our times, signifiers of cultures increasingly under siege, hostage to religious fanaticism, or to impoverishing globalization,” Gaasch explains. “This small book reaffirms the rights of these masks to continue to dance.”

The History of Congressional Apportionment,"Biles, Charles M","NEW REVISED SECOND EDITION.
The Congressional apportionment problem is deceptively easy to state: How many seats in the U. S. House of Representatives does each state get? To answer that question, Charles Biles, award-winning Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Humboldt State University, examines the math and politics that has shaped government and power from the founding of the country to the modern day.
Employing an interdisciplinary approach that stems from his research in mathematical modeling and the modeling of natural resource systems, Biles tells a flowing evolutionary tale of how slight changes in calculating apportionment has wrought massive shifts in political power and even decided presidents. Bile’s work adds another chapter to the rich story of American history and the people, politics, and debates that continuously shape the political system we have today.
This second edition includes a detailed account of the reapportionment based on the 2020 census, the impact of extreme partisanship, and an account of the precarious road ahead for the electoral college. This is an essential read for anyone who wants to understand the past and future of our representative democracy. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1004/thumbnail.jpg",United States History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/5
Y.E.S. 50 Years of Community Building,"Andrews, Erika ; Ramirez-Sebree, Amanda","Youth Educational Services (Y.E.S.) is more than just an easily acronymed program title. It’s a piece of Humboldt State University history. What started as an off-the-cuff idea has grown into a formidable force on campus and the community.
Y.E.S. provides community engagement programs for HSU students to volunteer in local school and community sites. Y.E.S. programs are student-initiated and student-led and directly serve local community needs. By creating a collaborative, inclusive and safe environment, Y.E.S. volunteers become active creators of their own learning.
Thousands of volunteers and community members have benefited from Y.E.S. programs. These are the threads that weave together the contributions of five decades of Y.E.S. community members, a quilt created by hands and hearts of all ages. This book honors all the voices and perspectives shared, and those yet to be shared, that together form the powerful legacy of Y.E.S.

"Humboldt Bay Shoreline, North Eureka to South Arcata A History of Cultural Influences","Rohde, Jerry","In 1850 the area east of Arcata Bay was a tapestry of wetlands and sloughs, fringed by conifer-clad hillsides. Canoe channels and trails connected a string of Wiyot villages that nearly encircled the bay.
Then white settlers arrived, establishing towns at Eureka and Union (Arcata). With them came profound changes in the landscape. Rock quarries. Log drives. “Reclaimed” ranchland. An airport. Four and a half railroads. In 170 years the area was transformed into a web of structures and infrastructures that connected what became the two largest cities in Humboldt County.
Recently a new period of change has begun, promising far greater effects. Global warming has created sea level rise, and Humboldt Bay will be the most severely affected area on the California coast. In response, elected officials, agency experts, and the general public need to make informed decisions about how to deal with the resultant rising water levels. We need to recognize that preparing for the bay’s future requires gaining knowledge of the bay’s past. This book will help start that process. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1015/thumbnail.jpg",Environmental Studies ; Nature and Society Relations ; United States History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/10
Toyon Seven Decades of Student Driven Publishing,"Andrews, Erika ; Galindo, Asha ; Godlin, Sarah","This book is meant to capture the history and spirit of Toyon literary journal from its origin in 1954 to the future that surely will exist beyond these pages. The aim of this book is to inform future Toyon staffers of the unique history of the publication, to stress the importance of maintaining archives, and to provide insight into the inner workings of book/magazine production over the last 60+ years.
This book is also a place to tell the story of a student-run publication from the perspective of the student. We, Erika and Asha, are two former Toyon staff members who worked on issues 65 and 66, in the years of 2019 and 2020, respectively. We hope that these pages will entertain as well as educate—and that it truly honors the passionate and dynamic voices of the student editors, contributors, and volunteers that have published this magazine year after year.
We have striven to include many details and first-hand accounts and to properly interpret the information archived in the Humboldt State University library special collections. As with any archive, gaps remain in the history of Toyon that we’ve been able to access; for some periods we had very little information other than the finished magazine. In these instances, we worked hard to summarize what we could and fill in gaps using course catalogues and other materials from the archives to properly capture the era. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1016/thumbnail.jpg",United States History ; Cultural History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/11

What Kind of Future Will Our Children Inherit?,"Oliner, Samuel P. ; Swartz, Ronnie","Over the years, my students, research associates, and I have reviewed the literature of psychology, ethics, ecology, climatology, and other areas of study to consider the direction in which our world is going and what kind of future our children will inherit. Our previous work focused on the nature of good and evil—with concern especially for goodness—through which we have considered good in the world and the application of good to achieve a better world. Our books concerned altruism, kindness, empathy, and moral responsibility for diverse others. In this book we concentrate on the areas of greatest concern regarding our future as a species. Scholars are warning us about the direction we are taking in this interconnected world. Many of these experts view our global situation as a “glass half empty”; their studies reveal a future that is bleak and on the verge of catastrophe. There are, however, other scholars who view the world and humanity’s future in more optimistic terms—those who see the “glass half full.” My own work indicates that goodness, defined as concern for others and for making the world a better place, is on the rise.
Making the world a better place is not simply about the glass being half full or half empty; it is both at the same time. With the complexity of global trends comes major challenges, and one cannot say that one perception is correct and the other incorrect. It is much more complicated than that. We have an emergence of those who see the future as promising and perhaps even more harmonious than we have ever imagined, as well as those who believe that we are declining and ruining ourselves. A number of institutions, groups, governments, and individuals have taken these challenges to humanity seriously—have “seen the light”—and are trying to do something about the future state of the world.
This book describes two sides to the future our children stand to inherit: the glass half full and the glass half empty of what has been the trajectory of the world, it seems, since the beginning of human history. The arc of human progress has at times taken major leaps forward; at other times it appears to have lain dormant, only to burst forth with a new energy at a later time. In this collection of writings, we have attempted to show both sides of the picture because to do otherwise would leave this endeavor incomplete. Depicting only the negative would lead one to think that there is nothing positive moving us forward; depicting only the positive would suggest that we have no further work to do.
What kind of future will our children inherit? It is a future like all futures—it contains both an evolution of our species towards a higher level of consciousness and a resistance to such change. This has been the balancing act throughout human history. It will be incumbent upon our children to make sure that the glass of the future is half full.

Ecopsychology Revisited,"Conesa-Sevilla, Jorge","Ecopsychology Revisited is a critique of and deconstructive approach to several trends termed “ecopsychology.” This work attempts to bring light to some of the misconceptions that have hardened as “ecopsychology,” as these ideas have been reinterpreted and sometimes oversimplified by the general public and some professionals outside mainstream psychology. Part of the confusion arose when “ecopsychology” became inadequately amalgamated with other ideas. Nevertheless, within the social and behavioral sciences, at least, there is great value in devising and applying evidence-based strategies that track the normative ramifications dealing with cognition, emotion and behavior, exploring how or why humans relate to natural processes in a wide range of ways. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1012/thumbnail.jpg",Other Psychology ; Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/7

A Photographic Exploration of Wigi (currently called Humboldt Bay),"Laird, Aldaron","For decades, Aldaron has walked the shores of the bay, climbed its nearby sand dunes, and kayaked its entire periphery, taking over 25,000 photos that reveal the beauty of Wigi as it might appear in some magical, glimmering dream. From those thousands of photos, Aldaron selected 119 for this book. For each photo he kept, he discarded 209 others, which means that of those 25,000 images, he used less than one percent. We might think that taking all those photos required a tremendous amount of work, but it soon becomes clear that Aldaron did not work on this book, he lived and breathed its very essence, so that every photo he did select opens like a window, showing us yet another wonderful facet of Wigi, this place of ten thousand smaller places where land and water so subtly, so strikingly meet. -Jerry Rohde ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1028/thumbnail.jpg",Landscape Photography ; Wiyot Ancestral Lands ; Climate Change ; Humboldt Bay ; Photography,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/23

"Sewing Their Stories, Telling Their Lives Embroidered Narratives from Chile to the World Stage (1969-2016)","Manier, Martha J.","Embroidered narratives by women living in rural areas, shanty towns, inner cities, and refugee camps dominated markets during the last quarter of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st. Sewing Their Stories, Telling Their Lives traces the beginning of this artistic movement from three independent Chilean sources to other countries on five continents. Moreover, this richly illustrated book’s own story defines an art form without academic overlay or political agenda but from the artists’ own perspectives, recounted directly in interviews and at sewing tables around the globe.
For Martha J.

"American Prometheus Carnegie's Captain, Bill Jones","Gage, Tom","American Prometheus: Carnegie’s Captain, Bill Jones presents a compelling historical memoir of the illustrious life of rebellious steel genius and inventor, Captain Bill Jones.
Hero of the Civil War and Johnstown Flood, Captain Bill Jones built and supervised the Edgar Thomson Steel Works, which in its first five years advanced to the rank of the world’s most productive and profitable steel mill. His “hands-on, all over” style solved Carnegie’s production problems on the spot, enlisted baseball teams from the Works’ departments to defuse ethnic strife, promoted the eight-hour work day, and patented inventions, including the Jones Hot Metal mixer, which revolutionized the steelmaking industry, all while turning down Carnegie’s offers of partnership.
A deft blend of historical narrative and family memoir, this absorbing account of Jones’ dynamic life as a founding key figure in post-Civil War America’s Second Industrial Revolution and as a philanthropist in his own right, is told by none other than his great-grandson. Tom Gage moves beyond the role of biographer and storyteller to delve into research that traces Jones’ relationship to the steel magnate and explores the mysteries posed by family lore. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1003/thumbnail.jpg",United States History ; 8-hour day ; Biography ; North America ; Literature in English ; History ; Second industrial revolution ; Carnegie,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/4
Rescue of Memory,"Oliner, Samuel P. ; Swartz, Ronnie","What motivates people to help, to care, to risk their own lives for others? What differentiates rescuers, helpers, carers, and bystanders?
There is no single explanation. Anyone who offers you a single explanation of why people do good things is oversimplifying. Empathy is very important. So is courage. And compassion. Bystanders, I want to impress on you, are not evil people; they are not people who should be put in a ship and sent to outer space. They are also good human beings, but they have not internalized some of the ethics of caring, of social responsibility, of knowing. They may not have learned from moral parents, role models, or ethical communities that we are our brothers’ and sisters’ keepers. That’s what makes me so optimistic at this stage in my life. In fact, teaching caring, compassion, and altruism is possible, is learnable, is doable. We can move millions of people from a role of neutral bystander—who say, “Well, these are not my people,” “I am too busy,” “It’s too dangerous,” “I don’t have the time,” and so forth. These people can be sensitized to the consequences of indifference. I know it is possible to teach people to care and then we can transform the bystanders, perhaps, into more helpers, altruists, and compassionate actors. -Dr. Samuel P. Oliner.

Northern Humboldt Indians History of Humboldt County People and Places,"Rohde, Jerry","In what is now Humboldt County and southern Klamath County, seven Indian tribes made their home: the Mawenok, Whilkut, Tsnungwe, Hupa, Karuk, Yurok, and Wiyot. They arrayed themselves upon the land and sent their roots down into the earth, so that they had become as one with the place. Their villages were of long standing, and even their individual houses could sometimes be traced back, by name, for hundreds of years. In 1850, whites arrived on the shores to rage like a gale across the land. For 15 years the gale would sweep up the rivers and over the ridges and tear loose much of what the Indians had established in their homelands. And still the wind continued to blow, as the desire for gold was replaced by other desires—for ranchland, for timber, and even for the salmon. The wind blows yet.

Love and Rutabaga,"Accomando, Claire Hsu","In Love and Rutabaga, Claire Hsu Accomando reflects on her formative years growing up in war-torn France. Born in 1937 to a French mother and Chinese father, Accomando was just a child when her father departed for China on diplomatic duty in 1941. Left behind, she and her younger brothers were raised by their mother and grandparents in the small village of Rahon during the German occupation.
Despite the fear and uncertainty of World War II, Accomando paints a surprisingly joyful and richly textured portrait of those years. Her grandparents' home became a sanctuary - not just for their family, but for anyone in need of refuge. Her grandmother's love of music and storytelling brought beauty and wonder into a world clouded by conflict.
Blending humor, tenderness, and the innocence of a child's view, Accomando recounts the everyday moments that defined her childhood. The title's pairing of ""love"" and ""rutabaga"" captures the dual essence of affection and survival that sustained her family. Through engaging storytelling and vivid detail, she offers a unique memoir of resilience, warmth, and unexpected happiness in the midst of war. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1035/thumbnail.jpg",Music ; World War II ; Village Life ; Cultural History ; Nazi Occupation ; Family ; Resistance ; Humor ; Memoir ; European History ; German Occupation ; Childhood ; Autobiography ; WWII ; France,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/28

Natural Resources Biometrics,"Kiernan, Diane","Natural Resources Biometrics is a peer reviewed open textbook that begins with a review of descriptive statistics, estimation, and hypothesis testing. The following chapters cover one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), including multiple comparison methods and interaction assessment, with a strong emphasis on application and interpretation. Simple and multiple linear regressions in a natural resource setting are covered in the next chapters, focusing on correlation, model fitting, residual analysis, and confidence and prediction intervals. The final chapters cover growth and yield models, volume and biomass equations, site index curves, competition indices, importance values, and measures of species diversity, association, and community similarity.
Diane Kiernan completed her Ph.D. in quantitative methods in forest science at SUNY ESF in 2007. She is currently teaching Introduction to Probability and Statistics and Forest Biometrics at SUNY ESF and Advanced Statistics at LeMoyne College in Syracuse, New York.

Distribution of the North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) in Northern California,"Appel, Cara L ; Zielinski, William J. ; Schlexer, Frederick V ; Callas, Richard ; Bean, Tim","Western Wildlife 4:17–28, 2017: The North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is one of the most widely distributed mammals in North America, but recent reports have suggested declines in parts of its range in the West. In California, little is known about the historical or current status of the porcupine, and maps of its distribution conflict considerably. Nevertheless, the species is of interest to natural resource managers. For much of the 1900s, foresters and others primarily treated porcupines as pests because of the undesirable damage they inflict feeding on trees and gnawing on manmade items in search of salt. More recently, porcupines have been recognized for their role in promoting forest structure and diversity, and as potential prey for the Fisher (Pekania pennanti). We collected records of porcupine occurrence in the northern part of California since the beginning of the 20th Century, relying on government and private databases, reports from the public, and other sources. These records confirm that porcupines may occur in most major regions and habitat types across northern California, in contrast to many published range maps. The contemporary distribution of porcupines in the state most closely resembles the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships System (CWHR) range map, which is based on projections of suitable habitat. We are unable to offer deeper insight into trends of abundance and possible changes in distribution because these records are likely spatiotemporally correlated with observer effort. This work is a first step and we recommend that a broader statewide effort be conducted to better understand the distribution, abundance, and ecology of North American Porcupines in California.

Nevertheless, the species is of interest to natural resource managers. For much of the 1900s, foresters and others primarily treated porcupines as pests because of the undesirable damage they inflict by feeding on trees and gnawing on manmade items in search of salt. More recently, porcupines have been recognized for their role as engineers, contributing important structure and diversity to forest ecosystems, and as prey for the imperiled Fisher (Pekania pennanti). We collected records of porcupine occurrence in the northern half of California since the beginning of the twentieth century, relying on government and private databases, reports from the public, and other sources. These records confirm porcupine distribution in most major regions and habitat types across northern California, in contrast to many published range maps, and most closely resemble the range map based on projections of suitable habitat developed by the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships System (CWHR). We are unable to offer deeper insight into trends of abundance and possible changes in distribution because these records are likely spatiotemporally correlated with observer effort. This work is a first step in what must be a broader statewide effort, and we encourage further research on the distribution, abundance, and ecology of porcupines in California.
The data provided here consists of 363 unique records of porcupine locations in northern California spanning the years 1908 to 2016. Records were obtained from a participant science project (porcufinder.com); internal California Department of Fish & Wildlife records; the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS); internal U.S. Forest Service Records; a study by former HSU Wildlife professor Charles Yocom; iNaturalist; and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The second tab includes descriptions of each column of the data, and additional information is available in the (forthcoming) publication.

What Should Go in a Wildlife Professional’s Geospatial Toolbox? (Response Data),"Bean, William ; Baumbusch, Ryan C ; Berger, Brooke ; Delheimer, Matthew ; Hecker, Lee J ; Lau, Matthew ; Milligan, Megan C","Geospatial tools have become a critical component to most wildlife studies and management questions. With a diversity of approaches available, current and future wildlife professionals deserve guidance on the most important tools to answer these questions. Younger professionals may be expected to know a separate set of skills from those required further on in their career. We conducted an online survey and a year-long search of job advertisements to identify the most important geospatial approaches, techniques, programs, and ancillary skills for wildlife professionals. We provide the results of these 2 efforts so that wildlife professionals interested in geospatial tools can prioritize those most valued in our field. Habitat modeling and home range analysis were the 2 highest-ranked tools. Highly ranked programs included ArcGIS, R, Google Earth, and Geospatial Modeling Environment. We suggest that wildlife professionals should have a geospatial program they are comfortable with and be conversant with the major approaches (e.g., habitat modeling, home range analysis, remote sensing, and mobile mapping) but need not be experts in each field. Younger professionals should focus on the “big picture” tools such as ArcGIS, while professionals further in their career are expected to have some expertise in multiple areas, including knowledge of current and emerging trends.
The data provided here consist of 123 unique responses to a survey administered online via a Google Form to wildlife professionals, from March 13 through May 26, 2015. Respondents were asked a series of questions related to their workplace, their experience with spatial tools related to wildlife management, their estimated value of a suite of spatial tools, and the value of a spatially-based curriculum for wildlife professionals. These data were analyzed and presented in a manuscript in Wildlife Society Bulletin (in press).",habitat analysis ; Science and Mathematics Education ; ArcGIS ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; connectivity ; Geographic Information System ; home range analysis ; remote sensing ; GIS ; training ; Biodiversity ; professional development,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/data/2

These six hydrologic units (Mad River Slough, Arcata Bay, Eureka Slough, Eureka Bay, Elk River Slough and South Bay) each share a common shoreline and exposure to tidal inundation. In addition to the six hydrologic units there are 24 hydrologic sub-units with shorelines consisting of diked structures. The hydrologic units encompass a tidal inundation footprint for 2.0 meters (6.6 feet) of sea level rise while the sub-units encompass just 1.0 meter of sea level rise (the sub-units begin to merge with increasing levels of sea level rise) (Figure 1), and include three local coastal program jurisdictions.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/hsuslri_local/1

Make Your Escape Experiences with Gamified Library Programming,"Miller, Tim ; Stelter, Kimberly ; Purchio, Garrett ; Hagen, Brianne N","To increase student engagement, the Humboldt State University Library ventured into the realm of gamified programming, exploring several strategies with the goal of trans- forming library outreach and instruction. Our efforts range from simple outreach to highly structured information literacy instruction and workshops that use gamification to encourage students to engage with knowledge practices and dispositions outlined in the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. Using gamified activities in library instruction led us to create lesson plans that are purely game-based, including escape room drop-in sessions where students race against the clock to solve a series of puzzles in order to “escape” the room. This model aimed to promote collaboration and problem-solving skills through inquiry-based learning.",Information Literacy ; Escape Rooms ; Gamification ; Games ; Libraries ; Library and Information Science ; Framework,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/librarian/1

Natural Resources Biometrics,"Kiernan, Diane","Natural Resources Biometrics is a peer reviewed open textbook that begins with a review of descriptive statistics, estimation, and hypothesis testing. The following chapters cover one- and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), including multiple comparison methods and interaction assessment, with a strong emphasis on application and interpretation. Simple and multiple linear regressions in a natural resource setting are covered in the next chapters, focusing on correlation, model fitting, residual analysis, and confidence and prediction intervals. The final chapters cover growth and yield models, volume and biomass equations, site index curves, competition indices, importance values, and measures of species diversity, association, and community similarity.
Diane Kiernan completed her Ph.D. in quantitative methods in forest science at SUNY ESF in 2007. She is currently teaching Introduction to Probability and Statistics and Forest Biometrics at SUNY ESF and Advanced Statistics at LeMoyne College in Syracuse, New York. She is employed as a biometrician analyzing long-term re-measurement data for the SUNY ESF forest properties and is involved with additional research projects at SUNY ESF. Diane has authored and co-authored two previous books on statistics currently being used in her classes.",model fitting ; confidence and prediction intervals ; species diversity ; variance ; comparison methods ; interaction assessment ; estimation ; ANOVA ; Bioinformatics ; competition indices ; community similarity ; correlation ; hypothesis testing ; biometrics ; descriptive statistics ; residual analysis,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/oer/1

"""Distribution of the North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) in Northern California"" Appendix","Appel, Cara L ; Zielinski, William J. ; Schlexer, Frederick V ; Callas, Richard ; Bean, Tim","Western Wildlife 4:17–28, 2017: The North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is one of the most widely distributed mammals in North America, but recent reports have suggested declines in parts of its range in the West. In California, we know little about porcupines’ historical or current status; maps of porcupine distribution conflict considerably. Nevertheless, the species is of interest to natural resource managers. For much of the 1900s, foresters and others primarily treated porcupines as pests because of the undesirable damage they inflict by feeding on trees and gnawing on manmade items in search of salt. More recently, porcupines have been recognized for their role as engineers, contributing important structure and diversity to forest ecosystems, and as prey for the imperiled Fisher (Pekania pennanti). We collected records of porcupine occurrence in the northern half of California since the beginning of the twentieth century, relying on government and private databases, reports from the public, and other sources. These records confirm porcupine distribution in most major regions and habitat types across northern California, in contrast to many published range maps, and most closely resemble the range map based on projections of suitable habitat developed by the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships System (CWHR). We are unable to offer deeper insight into trends of abundance and possible changes in distribution because these records are likely spatiotemporally correlated with observer effort. This work is a first step in what must be a broader statewide effort, and we encourage further research on the distribution, abundance, and ecology of porcupines in California.
The data provided here consists of 363 unique records of porcupine locations in northern California spanning the years 1908 to 2016. Records were obtained from a participant science project (porcufinder.com); internal California Department of Fish & Wildlife records; the California Roadkill Observation System (CROS); internal U.S. Forest Service Records; a study by former HSU Wildlife professor Charles Yocom; iNaturalist; and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.

Distribution of the North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) in Northern California,"Appel, Cara L ; Zielinski, William J. ; Schlexer, Frederick V ; Callas, Richard ; Bean, Tim","Western Wildlife 4:17–28, 2017: The North American Porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) is one of the most widely distributed mammals in North America, but recent reports have suggested declines in parts of its range in the West. In California, little is known about the historical or current status of the porcupine, and maps of its distribution conflict considerably. Nevertheless, the species is of interest to natural resource managers. For much of the 1900s, foresters and others primarily treated porcupines as pests because of the undesirable damage they inflict feeding on trees and gnawing on manmade items in search of salt. More recently, porcupines have been recognized for their role in promoting forest structure and diversity, and as potential prey for the Fisher (Pekania pennanti). We collected records of porcupine occurrence in the northern part of California since the beginning of the 20th Century, relying on government and private databases, reports from the public, and other sources. These records confirm that porcupines may occur in most major regions and habitat types across northern California, in contrast to many published range maps. The contemporary distribution of porcupines in the state most closely resembles the California Wildlife Habitat Relationships System (CWHR) range map, which is based on projections of suitable habitat. We are unable to offer deeper insight into trends of abundance and possible changes in distribution because these records are likely spatiotemporally correlated with observer effort. This work is a first step and we recommend that a broader statewide effort be conducted to better understand the distribution, abundance, and ecology of North American Porcupines in California.

What Should Go in a Wildlife Professional’s Geospatial Toolbox? (Response Data),"Bean, William ; Baumbusch, Ryan C ; Berger, Brooke ; Delheimer, Matthew ; Hecker, Lee J ; Lau, Matthew ; Milligan, Megan C","Geospatial tools have become a critical component to most wildlife studies and management questions. With a diversity of approaches available, current and future wildlife professionals deserve guidance on the most important tools to answer these questions. Younger professionals may be expected to know a separate set of skills from those required further on in their career. We conducted an online survey and a year-long search of job advertisements to identify the most important geospatial approaches, techniques, programs, and ancillary skills for wildlife professionals. We provide the results of these 2 efforts so that wildlife professionals interested in geospatial tools can prioritize those most valued in our field. Habitat modeling and home range analysis were the 2 highest-ranked tools. Highly ranked programs included ArcGIS, R, Google Earth, and Geospatial Modeling Environment. We suggest that wildlife professionals should have a geospatial program they are comfortable with and be conversant with the major approaches (e.g., habitat modeling, home range analysis, remote sensing, and mobile mapping) but need not be experts in each field. Younger professionals should focus on the “big picture” tools such as ArcGIS, while professionals further in their career are expected to have some expertise in multiple areas, including knowledge of current and emerging trends.
The data provided here consist of 123 unique responses to a survey administered online via a Google Form to wildlife professionals, from March 13 through May 26, 2015. Respondents were asked a series of questions related to their workplace, their experience with spatial tools related to wildlife management, their estimated value of a suite of spatial tools, and the value of a spatially-based curriculum for wildlife professionals. These data were analyzed and presented in a manuscript in Wildlife Society Bulletin (in press).",habitat analysis ; Science and Mathematics Education ; ArcGIS ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; connectivity ; Geographic Information System ; home range analysis ; remote sensing ; GIS ; training ; Biodiversity ; professional development,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/data/2

Our efforts range from simple outreach to highly structured information literacy instruction and workshops that use gamification to encourage students to engage with knowledge practices and dispositions outlined in the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. Using gamified activities in library instruction led us to create lesson plans that are purely game-based, including escape room drop-in sessions where students race against the clock to solve a series of puzzles in order to “escape” the room.

Integrating Campus Partners Towards Equitable Open Educational Resources Adoption A Case Study of a California State University Affordable Learning Solutions Program at Humboldt State University,"Stelter, Kimberly ; Morgan, Kyle ; Barker, Morgan","The Humboldt State University (HSU) Library and HSU Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) collaborated with the campus’ own Accessibility Resource Center, Student Disability Resources Center, and Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion through five training sessions, to facilitate the integration of open educational resources (OER) into the classroom. Faculty and students, from disparate disciplines, participated as equal stakeholders in the discovery and implementation of OER into a course, throughout a year-long immersive program.
This summary covers the history of the California State University (CSU) Affordable Learning Solutions (AL$) OER program at Humboldt State University; the structure of the 2019-2020 implementation of the program; and the results and conclusion to gauge the efficacy of our collective goal to reduce the material costs for students and expand open, equitable, and accessible practices into the classroom. This summary will specifically address the process of integrating inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility into OER adoption and curriculum design, for the purpose of advancing student success.

Affordable Learning Engagement and Publishing Strategies Empowering Opportunities for Open-Access Publishing,"Morgan, Kyle","As shown by a current $1.4 trillion in student loan debt (Experian, 2017), the affordability of a college education is one of the most crucial needs for students and the future of higher education. An increasing amount of that debt comes from textbook costs, which rose 812% from 1977 to 2012 (Perry, 2012). Studies by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund and the Student PIRGs (Senack, 2014), the Higher Education Coordinating Commission (HECC) Textbook Affordability Workgroup of Oregon (2015), Florida Virtual Campus (2016), and VitalSource Technologies (2017) have reported the deleterious effects on student success when students are not able to buy required textbooks.
Humboldt State University (HSU) Library has worked to address this issue by encouraging the replacement of commercially produced textbooks with open educational resources (OERs). The UNESCO website (2017) defines OERs as follows:
Open Educational Resources (OERs) are any type of educational materials that are in the public domain or introduced with an open license. The nature of these open materials means that anyone can legally and freely copy, use, adapt and re-share them. OERs range from textbooks to curricula, syllabi, lecture notes, assignments, tests, projects, audio, video and animation.
As part of this campaign, HSU Press has encouraged faculty and lecturers to develop their own OER textbooks to address gaps in current OER offerings. This chapter describes the efforts of Humboldt State University Press to develop OER textbooks, including:
A grant project to directly incentivize authors to publish open-access textbooks.   Collaboration in a grant project to incentivize faculty and lecturers to attend OER adoption seminars. Collaboration in a grant project to incentivize departments to redesign their courses and adopt OERs. Collaborations with faculty to publish student-authored open-access works. 
This chapter addresses the benefits and drawbacks of each effort as they pertain to our university, including the use of incentives and publishing as a transformational pedagogical tool. It also discusses the challenge of maintaining OER production, and the value of adopting a broader open access publishing model. In the context of HSU Press, open access refers to content—including educational material, scholarship, research, and creative works—that has been made available for free download and re-use under a Creative Commons license.
Publishing through open access supports the mission of libraries to facilitate the equitable dissemination of knowledge to all people. Open access publishing services also support the HSU campus community by creating and empowering campus authors, providing experiential learning opportunities, developing community outreach, and facilitating the university’s social justice mission. These successes not only justify the services of an open-access press, but allow for continued OER conversations and development on campus.",Higher Education,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/librarian/4
"Data Repository for ""North American Porcupine Distribution in the Pacific Northwest and Evaluation of a Non-Invasive Monitoring Technique""","Appel, Cara L ; Moriarty, Katie M ; Matthews, Sean M ; Green, David S ; Anderson, Stacy ; King, Evan ; Yaeger, J Scott ; Brown, Jeremy ; Bortot, Claire ; Bean, Tim","North American Porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) have a broad geographic distribution across much of the continent, but recent evidence suggests that their populations may be declining in some areas, including the Pacific Northwest. Estimating baseline historical and contemporary distributions of Porcupines is necessary for initiating monitoring efforts and, if necessary, informing strategic conservation actions. We compiled 1905 occurrence records of Porcupines in Washington, Oregon, and northern California from 1908 to 2018. Using maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), we created historical and contemporary distribution models based on Porcupine records from 1981–2010 and 2012–2018, respectively, to match the temporal scale of available environmental predictor layers and suspected onset of the decline. Our models suggested a recent shift in the occupied environmental niche of Porcupines in the Pacific Northwest away from forested areas and towards desert scrub and grassland vegetation communities. In addition, we tested a non-invasive survey method for determining Porcupine presence and monitoring their status over time. Our trials suggested that sodium-soaked wood blocks may provide an inexpensive and minimally invasive technique to detect Porcupines, but further testing is needed to understand its effectiveness and limitations.

"From Likes to Legislation How the Internet has facilitated hate speech, Anti-DEI discourse and policy, and threatens our democracy","Benavides-Garb, Carmen Lynn","I argue that the way hate speech, and Anti-DEI rhetoric spreads online, through social media and algorithms, has impacted real-world Anti-DEI policies, attitudes, and overall backlash. In this essay I will begin by discussing the four themes found in my literature review, 1) Online Hate Speech, 2) Social Media and Algorithms, 3) Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), and 4) Anti-DEI Movements. From there, I will discuss the historical background of DEI movements in America to provide context about what makes this moment in history unique. I will then discuss the role of the Trump Presidency in relation to Anti-DEI work. The majority of this essay will focus on how the internet fosters hate speech and the unique qualities of the internet and social media that promote the spread of racism and Anti-DEI rhetoric. I will discuss theories to explain these phenomena such as Algorithms of Oppression (Noble), Critical Race Theory (Bell), and Surveillance Capitalism (Zuboff). I will conclude this essay by discussing the intentional misrepresentation of DEI online and argue for the benefits of DEI work.

Poaching Impact on Golden Eagle Abundance on the Navajo Reservation,"Shirley, Antoinette ; Mikesic, David ; Smith, Chad","The Navajo people use eagle feathers in numerous ceremonies ranging from graduations to protection. The process to get eagle feathers legally requires countless paperwork for the US Fish and Wildlife and a wait time of around two to three years. Thus the black market for feathers has grown exponentially (Jenkins 2005). The Navajo Nation Zoo and Botanical Garden has implemented a recent plan in 2012 to release naturally shed feathers from their four captive Golden Eagles to the tribal people with proper permits. This process still requires paperwork, but the time span of filing for a feather and actually receiving one is only two to three months. I hypothesized that this ability to release feathers to its tribal members has decreased the rate of poaching. I worked closely with the Navajo Nation Zoo and Botanical Garden, as well as the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife, organizing and searching through field collected date from the past ten years. We found that while poaching is still increasing it is now doing so at a much slower progression, especially among juvenile birds. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1000/thumbnail.jpg",Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; Biology ; Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1
Microhabitat Selection of Pacific Giant Salamander Larvae,"Watling, Rebecca","Pacific giant salamander larvae (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) inhabit headwater streams and are sensitive to heavy sedimentation and stream degradation. I looked at levels of sedimentation within and between plots in a headwater stream, and salamander use of substrate types to determine if they were selecting against sediment. I found that they used sediment proportionately less than it was available and small woody debris proportionately more than it was available. Pacific giants are indicators of stream quality, and can be used to direct management and logging regulations. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1000/thumbnail.jpg",Life Sciences ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1
Snowy Egret Foraging Success in Relation to Tide Levels,"Juarros, Alexander","Energy intake is important for wading birds as it maintains body processes that allow them to survive and reproduce, therefore it is important to study the effects that can potentially affect wading’ ability to forage (Schmidt-Nielsen 1997). Factors that may influence wading birds foraging behavior can be biotic or abiotic, such as tide levels (Maccarone and Parsons 1994, Maccarone and Brzorad 2005). This abiotic variable can affect the strike rate and foraging success of certain wading species, such as the snowy egret (Egretta thula) (Barnhart et al. 1992). To determine if snowy egrets foraging behavior is affected by changing tide levels, 10-15 minute focal observations were conducted in the Arcata Marsh during low, medium, and high tide. After observing 32 individual snowy egrets in the Arcata Marsh, strike rate did not vary between the tide levels, but the foraging success of snowy egrets was higher at lower tides. Potential reasons why strike rate did not vary between the different tide levels could be due to prey abundance and source or the foraging method used by snowy egrets in relation to the tide. These variables could be explored in future studies to see if they vary among tide levels. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1001/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/3
The Influence of Light Intensity on Black-crowned Night Heron Roost Departure,"Miranda, Melissa A","Black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) are nocturnal wading marsh birds in the family Ardeidae. I studied the departure of black-crowned night herons from their roost in northwestern California, and light intensity, measured in Lux, from September to November 2016. There was a strong, negative correlation between light intensity and roost departure in this species. 976 individuals were observed, in which over 94% did not depart from the roost until ≤ 0.3 Lux. The optimal roost departure light intensity was 0.0 Lux. The first heron left the roost 22 minutes after sunset, on average. Finding that light intensity heavily influences black-crowned night heron roost departure behavior could perhaps propel further more intensive studies to focus on the spectral sensitivity and visual abilities of this species. Management implications include advising developers against constructing light fixtures that give off high intensity near roost sites, to avoid affecting the behavior of black-crowned night heron roost departure flight patterns. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1002/thumbnail.jpg",Other Animal Sciences ; Ornithology ; Zoology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/2

Pacific Wren Singing Behavior in Relation to Temperature,"Gorman, Riley L","The effects of climate change on bird behavior have not been well researched (Moller 2010). Song production is believed to be energetically expensive (Johnson and Rashotte 2002) and a behavior that is mutually exclusive of foraging and resting (Thomas 1998). I studied how ambient and overnight temperatures affected the average song length, number of songs and total time spent singing in Pacific wrens in the Arcata Community Forest in Humboldt, California. Data was collected in 5 minute listening surveys with a sound recorder and later analyzed. I found that the average song length of Pacific wrens significantly increased after warmer nights. However, the number of days from the start of the surveys and overnight temperatures were also strongly correlated. It is possible that an increase in song length is either due to the onset of the breeding season or an increase in temperature or both. Knowing how temperature affects Pacific wrens could help researchers adjust detection probabilities for surveys (Slagsvold 1977) and evaluate how changes in forest structure and microclimates (Chen 1999) might affect their behavior. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1004/thumbnail.jpg",Ornithology ; Behavior and Ethology ; Zoology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/5
"If You Build It, They Will Come Nest Site Selection of Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) in West-central Idaho","Meisman, Elizabeth ; Styhl, Tyrell ; Krouse, Bryan ; Bechard, Marc ; Miller, Robert ; Johnson, Matthew ; Perkins, Dusty","Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) are fish-eating, top predators of aquatic ecosystems that serve as useful sentinel species for monitoring environmental contaminants and ecosystem health. Ospreys further appear highly adaptable to human-dominated landscapes and readily nest on artificial structures that occur within an array of land use and land cover (LULC) types and human settlement regimes. In Long Valley Idaho, the abundance of breeding Ospreys has declined slightly since the late 1970’s while the distribution of nests and nest substrate use has changed dramatically. To evaluate if changes in nest structure availability and use, coupled with increasing anthropogenic landscape conversion, could be changing osprey nest site selection, we evaluated relationships among nest site characteristics. We used multivariate generalized linear models with model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of LULC composition and nest site characteristics associated with nest occupancy. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1005/thumbnail.jpg",Ornithology ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/6
Using Life History Traits to Understand Human Perception of Visual and Vocal Attractiveness of Songbird Species,"Wong, Jane M.","Sexual dimorphism occurs in many songbird species, where plumage ornamentation and song are greatly exaggerated. Studies have shown that life history traits like nest shape and ecological environments may influence sexual selection in birds. In this study, I examined whether or not certain life history traits affect human perception of attractiveness in birds. Using previous scores of human perceived attractiveness of song and plumage, I ran a candidate model set of linear regression models and ranked them based on the Akaike information criterion correlation (AICc) scores of life history covariates to determine the top model of the candidate set. Using the top model, I predicted scores for 15 new songbird species. I found a negative correlation between visual and vocal attractiveness when comparing the top 5 song covariates. A weak positive correlation was found when only comparing the top 5 plumage covariates and the different top 5 song and plumage covariates. This study may further inform conservation biologists about human perception of birds to raise awareness of avian conservation in order to protect unique songbird species. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1006/thumbnail.jpg",Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/7
Compensatory Grass Growth Response in a Simulated Goose Grazing and Fecal Fertilization Experiment,"Hecocks, Sarah J","To quantify the effects that wintering Aleutian cackling geese have on agricultural grasslands in Humboldt County, I conducted an experimental study to determine the levels at which grazing and fecal fertilization can both benefit and inhibit the regrowth of ryegrass, a preferred forage species. Results indicated that growth rates are highest at low to moderate levels of grazing, high levels of fertilization, and moderate levels of both grazing and fertilization (1.83g/day). The control, receiving no treatment, yielded the second lowest growth rate (0.78 g/day). I concluded that the combination of herbivory and fecal fertilization at a moderate level is important for plant stimulation, and suggests that a mutualistic relationship exists between Aleutian geese and pasture grass. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1007/thumbnail.jpg",Agricultural Science ; Ornithology ; Poultry or Avian Science ; Agronomy and Crop Sciences ; Biodiversity ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/8
A Comparative Color Analysis of 49 Bird Species and the Relation of Habitat Factors to Plumage Coloration in a Tropical Forest,"Suarez, Alyssa","Over time, birds develop phenotypic traits, such as plumage coloration, that may allow them to blend in with their environment or simply stand out for various reasons. These traits can be expressed in three pigments: carotenoids, porphyrines, and melanins. These traits can be influenced by a number of factors, such as species diet, habitat, and ecosystems. To explain what environmental factors may have an effect on bird coloration and specific plumage pigmentation, we studied three habitat factors that act as proxies to the quality of environment, and that can affect variation and intensity of plumage coloration in a tropical forest. The three factors: habitat openness, vegetation diversity, and soil quality, were studied at seven forest fragments in Southern Costa Rica. Using a comparative color analysis among numerous bird species, we determined that birds in open habitats were less saturated in order to avoid predation. Birds in areas that had a greater diversity of vegetation had more color variation due to the fact that they were exposed to a larger diversity of ecological niches. Birds that were studied in areas with richer soil had greater color variation as well, due to a healthier ecosystem. Previous studies lack analyses focusing on these particular factors in relation to bird coloration. This study is important to understand the interactions of bird species within their abiotic and biotic environments and how these interactions can influence plumage coloration in a tropical forest, which in turn may translate into greater diversity of animal behaviors.

Using eDNA to detect Pacific lamprey,"Boone, Ely Daniel","The Pacific Lamprey, Entosphenus tridentatus, is one of the most broadly distributed freshwater fish in western North America. The home range of Pacific Lamprey once stretched from Baja Mexico to Alaska. Over the last few decades, their population has declined with a northerly contraction up the coast. There are few management practices dedicated to the Pacific Lamprey compared to other anadromous fish. The habitat of the Pacific Lamprey is thought to be that of larger tributaries and excludes smaller streams. Other research has supported this hypothesis. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a modern detection technique that is more sensitive and has a higher probability of detection than traditional methods. By using eDNA to compare large and small rivers, the modern sampling technique has provided more supporting evidence to the hypothesis that in Northern California, Pacific Lamprey only utilize large tributaries. This knowledge can aid in improved management practices. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1002/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/3
Assessing phenological trends of deciduous trees at Harvard Forest and throughout the northeastern United States,"Saldivar, Jolene A","Phenology is the study of biological activities influenced by seasonal environmental changes. These changes drive ecosystem functions and services and have been found to be influenced by climate change. The methods for documenting phenology have expanded from ground observation to more advanced methods including digital repeat camera and satellite imagery. Additionally, citizen science programs have contributed observations to nationwide databases. I utilized Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) and data provided by the USA National Phenology Network’s (USA-NPN) citizen science project Nature’s Notebook to examine the phenological trends of five deciduous tree species throughout the northeastern United States. I assessed the accuracy of predicting phenological events and the degree to which various abiotic factors influenced phenology. To predict leaf out dates, an accumulated growing degree day (AGDD) model was developed. The model gave an overall root mean squared error (RMSE) of 25.5% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 12.6%. Canopy position was found to significantly affect the timing of leaf out and leaf fall for trees located at Harvard Forest. Additionally, leaf fall showed less variability than leaf out throughout all USA-NPN sites. Finally, ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD revealed varying degrees of significance for the timing of phenological events for species based on urbanization status. Overall, biotic factors played differing roles in the timing of phenology for all species across all sites. As interest in phenology continues to increase, there is great potential for further integration of scientific and citizen science data to assess trends and predict future changes. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1003/thumbnail.jpg",Biodiversity ; Forest Biology ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/4

Detection of Trace Metals in Seawater The Importance of UV-Oxidation,"Ghaffari, Parisa ; Till, Claire P","According to oceanographic research, trace metals are essential in life of marine phytoplankton, since many trace metals are micronutrients that are essential for biological processes. However, due to extremely low concentrations of trace metals in seawater, it is difficult to measure their concentrations; therefore, specific analysis methods must be performed in order to determine the concentrations of trace metals. One of the techniques, which is required prior to extraction process, is UV-oxidation in which strong organic ligands that chelate trace metals, such as copper (Cu) and cobalt (Co), are destroyed. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1005/thumbnail.jpg",Environmental Chemistry ; Inorganic Chemistry ; Marine Biology ; Analytical Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/7

Construction of Niemann Pick Disease Type C1 HEK293 Cell Model utilizing CRISPR Gene editing,"Valencia, Stephanie ; Kraff, Austin ; Nisson, Haley ; Steele, John W, IV","Niemann Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder
that affects 1:150,000 people. The disease is characterized by cholesterol
accumulation within lysosomes, as well as clinical cognitive decline and
neurodegeneration. These symptoms can be attributed to a mutation in the
NPC1 gene that leads to the interruption of the intracellular cholesterol
transport. Using CRISPR Cas9 technology, the ability to make a cellular
model with inducible CRISPR gene regulation can give researchers
considerable insight into the cellular pathology of Niemann Pick Disease
Type C1 as well as the ability to apply targeted drug therapy and potentially
lead to drug discovery. We hypothesize that by using bioinformatics, a
CRISPR cas9 system, and genome editing we will make a functioning
HEK293 NPC1 cell model with inducible CRISPR gene regulation. To build
this system, we 1) used online bioinformatics tools to build primers, 2) Hifi
Assembly of mCherry coding sequence with pUC19 plasmid, 3) utilized
gene editing technology with the purpose of inserting the mCherry (a
fluorescent protein) coding DNA sequence into the NPC1 gene and 4)
inserted the built sequence into HEK 293 cells via CRISPR transfection.
Preliminary results show a successful build of the DNA sequence insert
containing the mCherry coding sequence which has been confirmed by
restriction digest and gel electrophoresis. Once completed the model will be
tested in the hopes that it will follow the cellular mechanisms that lead to the

California Vole Runway Maintenance Is Not A Valid Indicator of Population Size,"Shofstall, Krista J",California voles (Microtus californicus) are a major prey resource for many raptor species. Determining vole population size has traditionally been done with mark-recapture using Sherman traps but this method is very invasive. Several less invasive techniques have been tried but proven to be unreliable. We tried to use toothpick obstructions to block runways and use obstruction clean up rates to determine population size. These obstructions proved to be unreliable due to the voles going around the obstructions and the rate of obstruction removal was variable. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1008/thumbnail.jpg,Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/9
CRISPR-Induced Overexpression of Huntingtin as a Cellular Model of Huntington's Disease,"Blumenshine, Dixie ; Steele, John","Huntington’s disease (HD) is associated with CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, which encodes the huntingtin protein. HD progressively damages patients’ neurological function and causes eventual death earlier in each generation affected. Age of onset has been associated with the number of CAG repeats found in the HTT gene. Many attributes of the disease-associated mutant repeats in HTT are not yet understood, including how neurons are damaged and the role of normal and mutant huntingtin proteins in modifying neuronal viability. Our central hypothesis is that overexpression of normal huntingtin, with the eventual inhibition of cells’ autophagy pathway or other route of clearance, will lead to a disease-like state. In order to address this hypothesis, we are developing a novel human cell model that will allow us to assess how excess huntingtin is managed and/or cleared by cells, and precisely how cell death occurs upon buildup of huntingtin protein. Overexpression of endogenous HTT gene products will be induced using our stably integrated inducible CRISPR transcriptional activator (dCas9-VP64 fusion) tools, allowing for transient and reversible transcriptional activation of the HTT gene. Using this model as a starting point, it is possible to study the response of human cells following overexpression alone or with modifications to autophagy pathways to reveal how abnormal expression contributes to cell death. Here we report our generation and preliminary characterization of this novel model system for the study of HD, which will eventually be utilized in drug discovery applications for this neurodegenerative disease. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1008/thumbnail.jpg",Neuroscience and Neurobiology ; Cell Biology ; and Neonatal Diseases and Abnormalities ; Disease Modeling ; Hereditary ; Congenital ; Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience ; Nervous System Diseases,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/9
Lack of Radio-Emission in Quasars with Extremely High Velocity Outflows,"Quintero, Carla Patricia ; Rodriguez Hidalgo, Paola ; Haas, Sean ; Moiz Khatri, Abdul ; Hall, Pat","We investigated whether there is a connection between radio emission and UV/Optical absorption in quasars. We used the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 9 (SDSS DR9), which is a public database that includes spectroscopic information of 87,822 quasars. From that, we are working with a subsample of 6,760 quasar spectra looking for outflows at extremely high velocities: outflowing at speeds larger than 10% the speed of light. We selected the brightest quasars and the ones at the right distance from Earth to be able to study the potential presence of these outflows. Our team has developed a python code in order to do this search systematically and has found 45 cases of quasars where the spectra presents extremely high velocity outflows. We will present that we have found a lack of connection between the presence of these extremely high velocity outflows and the quasars showing radio emission radio-loud. Out of the 45 cases, we only find 3 with potential radio loudness. We will discuss how we determine whether the quasars are radio loud and the implications of this lack of radio emission. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1009/thumbnail.jpg",Astrophysics and Astronomy,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/10
Mist-Net Capture Rates as an Index to Identify Trend in Passerine Abundance and Productivity,"Dante, Shane Bruce","To better understand what is affecting bird populations, it is necessary to examine abundance of bird species in specific locations, and to make comparisons that may reveal possible ecological factors for observed trends.  It may be helpful to compare population trends of Neotropical migrants and permanent residents, and species in different guilds. I examined a 23 year data set (1993 to 2015) from a constant effort mist-netting project conducted on the North Coast of California, using Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol. I analyzed capture rates per net hour as an index of abundance for 3 of the most commonly captured migratory song bird species and a common resident; namely, the Swainson’s Thrush, Wilson’s Warbler, Orange-crowned Warbler, and Song Sparrow. Using my index of abundance I found a decreasing trend in abundance for Swainson’s Thrush adults and hatch years (young known to have hatched in the calendar year), as well as for hatch year Song Sparrows. In addition, productivity remained steady throughout the study. Lastly, Swainson’s Thrush adult abundance in one year (t+1) was positively correlated with hatch year abundance the previous year (t). Wilson’s Warblers exhibited a negative correlation between adult abundance (t+1) and hatch year abundance (t). Analyses of data from the Wright Wildlife Refuge has not been published, spurring the need for my examination of passerine abundance and productivity in a relatively unchanged forest community. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1009/thumbnail.jpg",Population Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/10
Novel Tests of Gravity Below Fifty Microns,"Hernandez, Nicholas ; Comden, Zane D ; Dunkely, Noah K ; Isachsen, Hilde ; Johnson, Jeremy S ; Martinez, Gabriela D ; Sanchez, Anthony E ; Hoyle, Charles D","Gravity’s relationship to the other fundamental forces is still not well understood. The Standard Model of quantum mechanics describes interactions between the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces, while Einstein’s theory of General Relativity (GR) describes gravity. There is yet to be a theory that unifies inconsistencies between GR and quantum mechanics. Scenarios of String Theory predicting more than three spatial dimensions also predict physical effects of gravity at sub-millimeter levels that could alter the gravitational inverse-square law. The Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP), a central feature of GR, states that all objects are accelerated at the same rate in a gravitational field independent of their composition. A violation of the WEP at any distance scale would be evidence that current models of gravity are incorrect. At the Humboldt State University Gravitational Research Laboratory, an experiment is being developed to observe gravitational interactions below the 50-micron distance scale. The experiment measures the twist of a parallel-plate torsion pendulum as an attractor mass is oscillated within 100 microns of the pendulum, providing time varying gravitational torque on the pendulum. The size and distance dependence of the torque amplitude provide means to determine deviations from accepted models of gravity on untested distance scales. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1010/thumbnail.jpg",Physical Sciences and Mathematics ; Physics,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/11
Synthesis of alkenylthiols and their formation as self-assembled monolayers for use in the laccase-mediated removal of phenolic compounds,"Preciado, Ana","Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is an endocrine disrupting hormone polluting aquatic systems resulting fish feminization. Current methods of remediation fail to remove enough of the pollutant or produce copious amounts of hazardous waste. Our proposed remediation system works by covalently binding EE2 to a self-assembled monolayer surface(SAM) via radical coupling. Via subsequent SAM polymerization our system allows us to quantify the amount of pollutant, unlike current EE2 removal methods. Adhering our synthesized target molecule (A2) to a gold surface created our SAMs. Surface IR verified successful gold SAM synthesis and was used to monitor changes in surface spectra over time in the presence or absence of laccase, phenol (our EE2 proxy), or both materials combined. The degree of SAM polymerization was unclear due to wide variation in initial absorption of the various gold SAMs utilized.

I found that owl diets were primarily composed of small rodents, particularly the California vole (Microtus californicus), which also made up most of the relative biomass of prey consumed (62.89%). I also estimated the food niche breadth of Barn Owls and concluded that while they have a specialist diet (FNB st = 0.07), they also exhibit an opportunistic feeding strategy in their ability to take a range of prey species. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1010/thumbnail.jpg",Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/11
CRISPR/Cas9 Endogenous Tagging of NPC1 in HEK293t and human iPSCs,"Valencia, Stephanie ; Steele, John W ; Lesch, Benjamin ; Anthoney, Kyle ; Mackie, Ariah","Niemann Pick Disease Type C1 (NPC1) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that affects 1:150,000 people. The disease is characterized by cholesterol accumulation within lysosomes, as well as clinical cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. These symptoms are associated with mutations in the NPC1 gene that leads to disruption of intracellular cholesterol transport. Our previous studies indicate that neurons from NPC1 patient iPSCs or the NPC1 I1061T mouse model display impaired turnover of damaged mitochondria. We hypothesized that the accumulation of damaged mitochondria in neurons results in premature neuronal death, driving neurodegeneration in NPC1 disease. Our prior studies also indicated that regulation of serotonin signaling or GLP1 receptor activity may improve mitochondrial burden in NPC1 disease. We sought to expand on these findings by developing new cellular models of NPC1 disease, including: endogenously EGFP- or mCherry-tagged NPC1 and isogenic NPC1 knockout lines with or without reporters. We chose to insert the coding DNA sequence for either EGFP or mCherry in the first coding exon, 3’ to the signal sequence. After cloning the left (LHA) and right (RHA) homology arms from genomic DNA surrounding the insertion site, we assembled a donor template with any of the following inserts between the LHA and RHA: (a) mCherry without stop codon; (b) mCherry with stop codon; (c) EGFP without stop codon; (d) EGFP with stop codon. The resulting donor templates produce either mCherry-NPC1 (a) or EGFP-NPC1 (c) fusion proteins or mCherry (b) or EGFP (d) transcriptional reporters without NPC1 gene function. All four sets are capable of functioning as fluorescent reporters of NPC1 gene expression, while only donors a and c are fusion proteins. We employed dual-nickase CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to insert these sequences into HEK293t cells, looked for successful homozygous insertion, and are beginning to use these tools to understand NPC1 gene expression in human cell types. Our future work will employ these tools in human iPSC models from controls or patients to understand allele-specific expression and/or act as isogenic knock outs to study NPC1 gene function in human iPSC-derived neurons. These cells will ultimately be combined with our inducible CRISPR interference or transcriptional activation system for small scale genetic screens and target discovery/validation efforts in our lab. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1015/thumbnail.jpg",Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience ; Nervous System Diseases ; Neuroscience and Neurobiology ; Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/16
"Quantification and Comparison of Microplastic Contents in Wild Mussels and Maricultured Oysters from Humboldt Bay, California Using Enzymatic Digestion Methods","Raemer, Daniel R","This research evaluates the microplastic contents of commercially maricultured Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and wild mussels (Mytilus edulis) from Humboldt Bay (HB), California.  Ten bivalves were collected from each of three different locations in HB: North Bay, Entrance Bay, and South Bay.  Oysters were purchased directly from a commercial oyster farmer who cultivates them in the North Bay. Bivalves were digested with proteolytic enzyme complexes, vacuum filtered, and microplastics were quantified by microscopic examination of filters.  All samples contained microplastics, with plastic fibers being the most abundant items. Significantly different concentrations of microplastic particles (plastic particles/g tissue wet mass) were found between mussels collected from different locations and from the cultured oysters (p = 0.000).  Mussels from North Bay contained the highest average concentration of microplastics (6.29 ± 1.73 items/g) and were significantly different from all other groups.  Microplastic concentrations in Entrance Bay (3.39 ± 1.19 items/g) and South Bay (2.29 ± 1.75 items/g) mussels were intermediate and not significantly different from each other (p = 0.452).  Oysters contained the lowest microplastic concentrations (0.72 ± 0.34 items/g) and were significantly different from North Bay (p = 0.000) and Entrance Bay (p = 0.001) mussels, but not from the South Bay mussels (p = 0.104).

An Evaluation of Intensive Management Effects on Soil Microbial Biomass and Functional Diversity,"Smith, Colleen Lee","The effects of forest plantation management on soil microbial biomass and functional diversity can often be significant, but little is known about changes over time. We conducted a study to observe the long-term effects of management strategies used in the Southeastern Tree Research and Education Site (SETRES). This well-characterized site is a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stand composed of 4 treatments: control, irrigated, fertilized, and both irrigated and fertilized. Microbial biomass and functional diversity were first measured at this site throughout the early-mid 1990’s where a significant increase in microbial biomass C and N was observed in the fertilized plots while irrigation had no effect. The use of irrigation in this study was subsequently terminated in 2010. Microbial biomass was quantified with the chloroform fumigation extraction technique for total C and N. We used Biolog EcoPlates™ and FF microplates™ to quantify both bacterial and fungal microbial functional diversity, respectively. By reevaluating the effects of these management strategies exactly 20 years later we can assess the long-term effects of fertilization and irrigation in a predominately sandy soil. Carbon source utilization was similar across treatments indicating that fertilization and irrigation did not have long-term impacts on functional diversity. In contrast to the prior study at SETRES, microbial biomass did not differ among treatments. Understanding the soil biological impacts of intensive management in plantation forestry may help us understand long-term nutrient cycling potential. The SETRES site is scheduled for harvest, and future research projects will evaluate the changes to the microbial community. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1017/thumbnail.jpg",Environmental Chemistry ; Environmental Sciences ; Earth Sciences ; Forest Sciences ; Soil Science ; Forest Management ; Environmental Indicators and Impact Assessment ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Forest Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/18

In order to study the enzymatic pathways of carotenoid production in Humulus lupulus L. (hops), plants were established in vitro by micropropagation of nodal explants. The young shoots of the Cascade variety were cultured on solid agar medium composed of a modified MS11 (Murashigee and Skoog, 1962) medium with plant growth regulators indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), and a-napthalene acetic acid (NAA)14. Successful in vitro cultures were selected to study regulation of enzyme phytoene desaturase (PDS). Using mesophilic DNA (27.1 ng/uL) of Cascade hops and primers, we were able to show that the enzyme phytoene desaturase 3 in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPDS3, ac: AT4G14210.1) shares some homology to hops phytoene desaturase (HlPDS, gnl|BL_ORD_ID| 16589). Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) allows us to target and amplify the conserved exon 13 of the HlPDS scaffolding gene. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1018/thumbnail.jpg",Biotechnology ; Horticulture ; Other Microbiology ; Bioinformatics ; Other Plant Sciences ; Plant Breeding and Genetics ; Food Chemistry ; Food Biotechnology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/19

Examining the role of the ADCY5 point mutation p.R418W on cellular cAMP levels  and how cAMP affects neuronal differentiation of murine stem cells,"Zepeda, Elizabeth ; Robertson, Kiana S","ADCY5-related Dyskinesia is a rare movement disorder, with early onset in childhood and adolescence. Previous studies have linked this disease to various point mutations in the ADCY5 gene; one study has demonstrated two of these mutations cause an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, the molecular basis of this disease phenotype has yet to be fully understood. Our study seeks to characterize the effects of one specific point mutation, p.R418W, on cellular cAMP levels using HEK293T cells, and to determine if increased cAMP levels affect neuronal differentiation using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Our initial experiments demonstrated successful differentiation of mESCs into a neuronal lineage, with 1-2% dopaminergic neuron production, detected by Immunocytochemistry (ICC). This preliminary data showed that treatment with 1400 uM cAMP did affect neuronal differentiation.The most striking finding was the presence of contracting neuronal clusters in the treated neurons, versus non-treated. Current experiments include creating a CRISPR model: a HEK293T cell line containing the p.R418W mutation. We have designed the appropriate guide RNA, confirmed a high transfection efficiency of the CRISPR components using fluorescence microscopy, and are currently screening colonies by sequence analysis. Once the mutant cell line is verified, it will be treated with pharmacological agonists to stimulate cAMP production in mutated cells as well as control cells. The amount of cAMP produced in mutated cells versus wild-type will be quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Once we characterize the amount of cAMP produced in the ACDY5 p.R418W 293T cells, we will see if this level of cAMP affects differentiation of mESCs to dopaminergic neurons using our optimized mESC differentiation protocol. This data will not only help us better understand the role of ADCY5 in neuronal development, it will be beneficial to our collaborators, in choosing appropriate drugs for screening of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), collected from ADCY5 patients. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1020/thumbnail.jpg",Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience ; Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/21
Searching for Trends in Atmospheric Compositions of Extrasolar Planets,"Weber, Kassandra A. ; Rodriguez Hidalgo, Paola ; Turk, Adam ; Maloney, Troy ; Kane, Stephen","Since the first exoplanet was discovered decades ago, there has been a rapid evolution of the study of planets found beyond our solar system. A considerable amount of data has been collected on the nearly 3,838 confirmed exoplanets found to date. Recent findings regarding transmission spectroscopy, a method measuring a planet’s upper atmosphere to determine its composition, have been published on a limited number of exoplanets. The aim of our work is to gather existing data on atmospheric planetary composition and search for potential trends in relation to the exoplanets’ orbital and physical properties. Due to their short periods and thicker atmospheres, hot Jupiter type planets have been our first target population. Out of 78 cases with periods shorter than 3 Earth days and radius larger than 1 Rj (Jupiter radius), we found previously-published data on the atmospheres of 15 hot Jupiters. Only 8 cases had an overlapping wavelength range that allowed comparisons: 4800 - 9000 Angstroms, and within that range only one exoplanet shows absorption in their atmospheric data. We report our findings on this set, which will be publicly available on the Habitable Zone Gallery, and our future work plans for expanding the dataset. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1021/thumbnail.jpg",Other Astrophysics and Astronomy ; Astrophysics and Astronomy,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/22
Investigating the genetic diversity of immune genes in a non native population of American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus),"Segovia, Luisa N ; Kiemnec-Tyburczy, Karen M","The American Bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is a highly invasive species that has successfully colonized different habitats around the world. Our project’s objective was to isolate and characterize the genetic diversity of a rapidly evolving immune gene in an invasive bullfrog population in California’s Sutter National Wildlife Refuge. The level of immune gene genetic variability in a population may help determine how resistant a population is to pathogens and how persistent an invasive population may be over time. Our hypothesis is that our focal population harbors high genetic diversity, consistent with its presence in Northern California for decades. To test our hypothesis, we amplified a Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned the alleles from each frog. We then assessed individual heterozygosity, number of alleles in population and genetic diversity of those alleles using standard population genetic metrics. Finally, we compared the genetic diversity within this bullfrog population to that found in other frog populations, including both native and non-native populations. We found that the levels of diversity in our focal population were similar to the levels found in native populations of other species and higher than in native species that have undergone population declines. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1022/thumbnail.jpg",Genetics and Genomics ; Population Biology ; Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/23
Design of a ChiA Surface Expression System for  Enhanced Biofuel Feedstocks,"Bowman, Kristian","The ChiA protein from Serratia marcescens is responsible for hydrolysis of 1,4 glycosidic bonds in N-acetyl-glucosamine chains, that comprise chitin. Chitin, being the second most abundant polymer, has untouched potential as a source for biofuel feedstocks. Here we aim to enhance chitinase activity through displaying the ChiA protein on the surface layer proteins (S-layers) of Caulobacter vibrioides. The S-layer of C. vibrioides is a nanometer scale hexagonal 2-D crystalline lattice composed of a single protein, RsaA, and covers the entire surface of the organism.

Application of the Abel Transform in Galaxy Visualization,"Malekos, Eric","The Vlasov-Poisson (V-P) system is a widely studied mathematical model in galactic dynamics [2]. Until recently solutions to this nonlinear integro-differential system were limited to a few special cases. Lately numerical models have been developed which generate fully self-consistent solutions satisfying the V-P system presented in the next section [1]. These models have enlarged the space of axially symmetric solutions to include toroidal, spindle-like, and disk-like cases and compositions thereof. These new solutions allow us to better understand the abundance of non-spherical galaxy-morphologies we observe in nature. In this work we apply an integral transform, which projects the models’ 3-dimensional representations onto 2-dimensional views. This allows us to better compare numerical solutions to observations of galaxies as they would appear when viewed edge-on through a telescope. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1024/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/25
Photodegradation of Chlorinated Organic Compounds in Surface Waters,"Tusei, Cristina L ; DiMento, Brian ; Aeppli, Christoph","Chlorinated organic compounds are produced in large quantities and used in industrial products as pesticides and solvents. They leach into aquatic environments and pose a health risk to aquatic organisms and humans due to lengthy residence times and slow biodegradation. However, sunlight has the potential to photodegrade these compounds and abstract chlorine atoms through the reaction with hydrated electrons (eaq-)  and hydroxyl radicals (∙OH). Dissolved organic matter (DOM) present in natural waters forms eaq- and ∙OH when exposed to sunlight and may facilitate photodegradation. While much research has been conducted on ∙OH, not much is known about the importance of eaq- in the degradation of chlorinated compounds in surface waters.
The research presented here explores the effects eaq- and ∙OH have on the photodegradation of a mixture of six chlorinated compounds in deionized and seawater matrices irradiated by simulated sunlight.
The results from these experiments suggest that hydrated electrons play a greater role in facilitating photodegradation of highly chlorinated compounds than do hydroxyl radicals. A clear depletion in four out of six chlorinated compounds was observed in irradiated samples in deionized water and with a source of eaq- . Although it cannot be said the results are statistically significant, a clear pattern is established. Initial experiments performed with natural seawater were not yet able to clearly identify the effects of  and further experiments must be conducted to understand the role DOM plays in photodegradation.
These results may be used for future reference in studying the fate of chlorinated organic compounds. By understanding the characteristics of free radicals produced by DOM, it is possible to predict the degradation rate of harmful chlorinated compounds in natural waters. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1025/thumbnail.jpg",Oceanography ; Environmental Chemistry ; Organic Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/26

Using Sleeping Beauty Transposon-mediated mutagenesis to drive the evolution of fluid shear stress resistance in a pancreatic cancer cell population,"Pope, Amanda N ; Stipp, Dr. Christopher ; Moose, Devon ; Henry, Dr. Michael ; Dupuy, Dr. Adam","The majority of cancer-related deaths occur as a result of metastasis of tumor cells from the site of the primary tumor to distant locations. During metastasis, tumor cells penetrate from connective tissue into the circulatory system, where they are subjected to mechanical stress due to high velocity blood flow (fluid shear stress, FSS). For metastatic tumors to form, tumor cells must survive FSS, exit circulation, and successfully colonize new locations. It had been assumed that the majority of tumor cells are eliminated by mechanical damage due to FSS, but some recent studies have revealed that many tumor cell types are able to activate signaling pathways that enable them to rapidly adapt to FSS1. Understanding the mechanisms of tumor cell resistance to FSS might enable new therapeutic strategies to disrupt the metastatic process by blocking the ability of metastatic tumor cells to survive FSS-induced mechanical damage. Because most but not all tumor cell lines examined display resistance to FSS2, we hypothesize that resistance to FSS is due to genetically selectable differences in signaling pathways that are activated in cells with intrinsic FSS resistance compared to FSS-sensitive cells. Here we will begin to test our hypothesis using MiaPaca pancreatic cancer cells, one of the rare tumor cell types we have encountered which lacks FSS resistance. We hypothesize that FSS-resistance can be reactivated in MiaPaca cells by mutagenesis followed by selection for FSS-resistant cells. To mutagenize MiaPaca cells and test our hypothesis, we have used the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. The system has two parts: the Sleeping Beauty transposase (SB) and a mutagenic transposon called pT2-Onc3. SB mediates the insertion of pT2-Onc3 at any TA-dinucleotide site in the genome (Fig.1). The pT2-Onc3 transposon can switch genes on or off, depending on where is inserted in the genome. It contains a strong promoter to drive gene expression, as well as spice donor and acceptor sequences that can disrupt gene expression or promote expression of truncated proteins (2). ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1027/thumbnail.jpg",Cancer Biology ; Molecular Biology ; Cell Biology ; Biophysics,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/27
"Do Depth, Substrate, and Orientation Affect PIT-tag Detection Probability?","Roos, Axel","I addressed how detection probability of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags is affected by depth, orientation of tags, and type of substrate. Seabirds consume wild salmonids that are implanted with PIT tags (Evans et al. 2012). These tags are often deposited at the seabirds’ colonies, providing a means to study their ecology (Evans et al. 2012). I tested if tags were detected in duff, sand, or no substrate- at different depths and with tags in the vertical, horizontal, or diagonal orientation. I also extensively scanned a plot at a multi-species heronry to get an estimated total of PIT tags, then rescanned the plot 10 times to determine how many tags were detected each trial. Detection probability decreased with depth, increased in the vertical orientation, did not differ between sand and duff substrates, and did not differ between diagonal and horizontal orientations. At the heronry site, there was a detection probability of 0.83 across the trials, which ranged from 0.74-1.00 detected. These findings provide beneficial information on what variables affect detection for future terrestrial PIT tag studies. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1011/thumbnail.jpg",Natural Resources and Conservation ; Statistical Models ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/12
Design of Possible Organic Photovoltaic Compounds and their Initial Computational  Assessment,"Ochoa Castillo, Albert ; Smith, Joshua R","The excessive use of fossil fuels has surged the need for alternative energy sources, such as solar energy. Here, possible organic photovoltaic (OPV) compounds were designed and their initial computational assessment was done. OPV compounds are carbon-based and use organic electronics as a semiconductor to produce electricity from the sun. There is a large interest in OPV cells because they are strong absorbers and come at a low cost of synthesis. In addition, OPV cells can potentially be an alternative to silicon solar cells. As silicon solar cells are often difficult to recycle after they are retired and leave a large carbon footprint after production. Density Functional Theory was used to calculate the HOMO-LUMO gap of the 26 compounds designed. Finding the HOMO-LUMO gap is an important parameter that helps determine the electrical properties of a material. Semiconductors such as naphthalene, 1,1’-biphenyl, and ɑ-septithiophene were used as the backbone. The main electron-withdrawing group (EWG) used here is thieno[3,4-c] [1,2,5]thiadiazole, among other thieno-thiadiazole derivatives. Seven of the 26 compounds demonstrated adequate results and four of them will be further pursued in an attempt to synthesize. Lastly, results suggest there is most likely a correlation between the amount of EWGs attached to the semiconductor and its calculated efficiency. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1028/thumbnail.jpg",Organic Chemistry,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/29
Forecasting Dissolved Oxygen as a Function of Atmospheric Pressure,"Ceja, Pricilla","The Ecological Forecasting Initiative (EFI), in collaboration with the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), has conducted a forecast challenge to grow the field of ecological forecasting by using data collected by NEON and weather forecasts made by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We contributed to the challenge by forecasting dissolved oxygen (DO) using atmospheric pressure in a state space framework at an aquatic NEON site, Lake Barco in Florida. Utilizing Bayes Theorem allows for the uncertainties to be quantified and partitioned into different sources of error and process variability, and then allows us to propagate them into the forecast. By utilizing the positive correlation between DO and atmospheric pressure, we hypothesized DO concentrations to be higher along with higher levels of atmospheric pressure because water is able to hold more DO at higher atmospheric pressures due to gas saturation decreasing. The results of this project contribute to the EFI-NEON goal of understanding aquatic systems by showing how a covariate of atmospheric pressure contributes to and affects ecological forecasts of concentration levels of DO. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/1029/thumbnail.jpg",Other Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Life Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/inrsep_posters/30

The History of Congressional Apportionment,"Biles, Charles M","NEW REVISED SECOND EDITION.
The Congressional apportionment problem is deceptively easy to state: How many seats in the U. S. House of Representatives does each state get? To answer that question, Charles Biles, award-winning Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Humboldt State University, examines the math and politics that has shaped government and power from the founding of the country to the modern day.
Employing an interdisciplinary approach that stems from his research in mathematical modeling and the modeling of natural resource systems, Biles tells a flowing evolutionary tale of how slight changes in calculating apportionment has wrought massive shifts in political power and even decided presidents. Bile’s work adds another chapter to the rich story of American history and the people, politics, and debates that continuously shape the political system we have today.
This second edition includes a detailed account of the reapportionment based on the 2020 census, the impact of extreme partisanship, and an account of the precarious road ahead for the electoral college. This is an essential read for anyone who wants to understand the past and future of our representative democracy. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1004/thumbnail.jpg",United States History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/5
"To Catch the Rain Inspiring stories of communities coming together to harvest their own rain, and how you can do it too","Grafman, Lonny","If water is life, rainwater is a fountain of life. The purpose of this book is to show how various communities have caught that fountain of life using rainwater catchment systems. This book looks at real, practical, global experiences of rainwater harvesting on individual, financially constrained, and community based levels through academic, mathematical and practical perspectives. This book can be used to learn practical skills, see inspiring examples, and to make math have more meaning. This book is for practitioners, DIYers, community members looking for water solutions, as well as for students and teachers in environmental science, environmental studies, sustainable design, international development, engineering, and mathematics. The book is broken into sections on rainwater catchment in general, types, components, gravity, calculations, implementation stories, useful links, conversions, and problem-sets.

Y.E.S. 50 Years of Community Building,"Andrews, Erika ; Ramirez-Sebree, Amanda","Youth Educational Services (Y.E.S.) is more than just an easily acronymed program title. It’s a piece of Humboldt State University history. What started as an off-the-cuff idea has grown into a formidable force on campus and the community.
Y.E.S. provides community engagement programs for HSU students to volunteer in local school and community sites. Y.E.S. programs are student-initiated and student-led and directly serve local community needs. By creating a collaborative, inclusive and safe environment, Y.E.S. volunteers become active creators of their own learning.
Thousands of volunteers and community members have benefited from Y.E.S. programs. These are the threads that weave together the contributions of five decades of Y.E.S. community members, a quilt created by hands and hearts of all ages. This book honors all the voices and perspectives shared, and those yet to be shared, that together form the powerful legacy of Y.E.S.

To Japan and Back The Art of Orr Marshall,"Marshall, Orr","How many ways are there to interpret an idea, to present a vision? The artist Orr Marshall's exploration of these questions is the subject of this book in text and images. Like most children, he began drawing pictures as soon as he could hold a pencil or a crayon, depicting the weird creatures of his imagination. He maintained a concentration on art through school, majoring in painting at Yale School of Art and Architecture where Josef Albers was his most inspiring teacher. Another interest of his was language study, especially Japanese and Chinese with their writing systems and calligraphy. He taught art in the San Francisco area, where he continued learning those languages. Then with a scholarship from the Japanese government he went to the National University of the Arts in Tokyo to study for a year and a half.
Orr Marshall finds inspiration in many places—especially in imagination and dreams; also in everyday surroundings when he sees promising source material. Ranging in technique from realism to semi-abstraction, he challenges himself further with questions and goals such as:   Could he paint entirely in patterns of colored dots yet retain a recognizable subject? Could he depict nudes—essentially curvilinear—made entirely of squares and rectangles of varied sizes? Could he turn the amorphous dreams of his mind's eye into something solid and believable for all to see? As a Westerner, could he mix scenes of modern Japan with traditional imagery, labeled with names of places and characters (including his signature) in various styles of Japanese calligraphy? 
These are a few examples of his approaches to art that require extensive preparatory sketches, drawings, paintings, to figure out how to do them. Along the way, through his trial studies he often discovers new ideas, new color combinations, leading him to yet other works. So he goes on creating, spurred by a constant flow of inspiration. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reprint/1007/thumbnail.jpg",Sculpture ; Painting ; Interdisciplinary Arts and Media,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reprint/6

"Humboldt Bay Shoreline, North Eureka to South Arcata A History of Cultural Influences","Rohde, Jerry","In 1850 the area east of Arcata Bay was a tapestry of wetlands and sloughs, fringed by conifer-clad hillsides. Canoe channels and trails connected a string of Wiyot villages that nearly encircled the bay.
Then white settlers arrived, establishing towns at Eureka and Union (Arcata). With them came profound changes in the landscape. Rock quarries. Log drives. “Reclaimed” ranchland. An airport. Four and a half railroads. In 170 years the area was transformed into a web of structures and infrastructures that connected what became the two largest cities in Humboldt County.
Recently a new period of change has begun, promising far greater effects. Global warming has created sea level rise, and Humboldt Bay will be the most severely affected area on the California coast. In response, elected officials, agency experts, and the general public need to make informed decisions about how to deal with the resultant rising water levels. We need to recognize that preparing for the bay’s future requires gaining knowledge of the bay’s past. This book will help start that process. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1015/thumbnail.jpg",Environmental Studies ; Nature and Society Relations ; United States History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/10

Toyon Seven Decades of Student Driven Publishing,"Andrews, Erika ; Galindo, Asha ; Godlin, Sarah","This book is meant to capture the history and spirit of Toyon literary journal from its origin in 1954 to the future that surely will exist beyond these pages. The aim of this book is to inform future Toyon staffers of the unique history of the publication, to stress the importance of maintaining archives, and to provide insight into the inner workings of book/magazine production over the last 60+ years.
This book is also a place to tell the story of a student-run publication from the perspective of the student. We, Erika and Asha, are two former Toyon staff members who worked on issues 65 and 66, in the years of 2019 and 2020, respectively. We hope that these pages will entertain as well as educate—and that it truly honors the passionate and dynamic voices of the student editors, contributors, and volunteers that have published this magazine year after year.
We have striven to include many details and first-hand accounts and to properly interpret the information archived in the Humboldt State University library special collections. As with any archive, gaps remain in the history of Toyon that we’ve been able to access; for some periods we had very little information other than the finished magazine. In these instances, we worked hard to summarize what we could and fill in gaps using course catalogues and other materials from the archives to properly capture the era. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/1016/thumbnail.jpg",United States History ; Cultural History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/monographs/11

Water quality evaluation of tire derived aggregate,"Maeda, Richela K","The primary objective of this study is to investigate the rate that potential water quality contaminants leach from tire-derived aggregate (TDA) as a function of time. A laboratory and field experiment is conducted to provide insight into both controlled and field settings. The laboratory portion of this study also provides a basis for evaluating the effect that alternating periods of wet and dry weather have on the potential water quality impacts of the leachate as compared to the worst-case operating condition, when TDA is constantly submerged (i.e., when placed below the permanent groundwater table). The field experiment is used to determine if the leachate constituents identified in the laboratory experiment are observed when TDA is used as a stormwater filtration media. This portion of the study also determines if a TDA fill followed by a soil layer provides removal of urban stormwater runoff constituents.
The laboratory experiment suggests that, of the 83 tested constituents, benzene, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), cadmium, zinc, iron, manganese, total phosphate, and total suspended solids (TSS) are leached from TDA and dissolved oxygen (DO) is altered by TDA. For the eight constituents suspected to leach from TDA, a decrease in release over time was observed, with release rates for the majority of these constituents reaching values below their respective detection limits by the end of the experiment. Of these constituents with Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs), only iron and manganese exceeded their respective Secondary MCLs, and these standards are an aesthetic rather than a human health concern.
The rate at which metals leach from TDA is the highest when continuously submerged. A higher loss in iron, manganese, and zinc was observed for TDA that was always wet compared to TDA that experienced short (1 to 7 days) cycles of wet and dry. At the end of the 15 month experiment, manganese, zinc, and iron cumulative mass losses (per kg of tire) were 1.7, 1.6, and 2.6 times greater under the always wet operating condition compared to the average of the other operating conditions. There was not a difference in the loss rates that could be attributed to the different wet and dry cycles investigated.
The results of the field experiment suggest that a TDA-soil system provides removal of the following constituents from urban stormwater runoff: acetone, cadmium, chemical oxygen demand, iron, lead, manganese, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), oil and grease, phosphate, and zinc. In addition, the constituents suspected to leach from TDA are removed by a TDA-soil system.
The results of this study have demonstrated that the use of TDA as a fill material in civil engineering applications is a responsible method of recycling automotive scrap tires. TDA fills that are seasonally or always saturated are very unlikely to compromise the quality of the receiving water. The number of potentially harmful compounds leaching from the TDA is limited, and the rate of leaching is sufficiently low that the concentrations of these compounds in the surrounding waters do not pose any environmental degradation. In addition, sufficient dilution and soil adsorption effects further reduce impacts compounds might have on receiving waters. Sufficient dilution and soil adsorption processes further reduce the potential impacts that these compounds might have on any receiving water.",Water quality ; Environmental engineering ; Organics ; Treatment ; Civil engineering ; Metals ; Civil Engineering ; Tire derived aggregate ; Stormwater ; Environmental Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/16
"Access to recreational open space in Patterson, Ca a geospatial analysis utilizing geographic information systems","Lynch, Leanne S.","Many cities throughout California have experienced land use shifts from prime agricultural land to developed industrial and residential areas without considering access to recreational open space. Access to recreation through open space or parks is beneficial for the health and well-being of the community while providing aesthetic value and potential preservation of local ecosystems. Since 2002 the City of Patterson, located in California’s Central Valley, has rezoned over 800 acres of agricultural land for urban and industrial use while developers reserved recreational open space (parkland) at locations inconvenient to existing neighborhoods. Although several acres of parkland have been added to the park infrastructure in new subdivisions, there still may be limited access to parks. This study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data collected through public participatory GIS (PPGIS) surveys to analyze the accessibility of parkland for Patterson residents based on proximity, crime and physical barriers, and statistical probability. Participants in the PPGIS study included citizens living in Patterson, community members employed in Patterson, City and County officials, and farmers whose lands either shared a border to the City of Patterson and/or existed within city limits. About one quarter of the total population of Patterson has low access to recreational open space based on proximity, but more than three quarters of survey respondents felt that there was some kind of barrier keeping them from accessing parks. Some results of this study are available within Patterson’s Parks and Recreation Master Plan Draft. Once the Master Plan Draft is approved, it is hoped that the results of this project will help the City planning department make well-informed decisions on improving access to parks, creating secure paths for children, promoting healthy and affordable alternatives to motor vehicle transportation, and better connect residents with poor access to parkland.

"Leadership, it's everyone's responsibility","Triplett, Bruce A","Abstract
Leadership, It’s Everyone’s Responsibility
Bruce A. Triplett
Leadership is something that is discussed in all facets of life. Specifically in sports, leadership is something that coaches view as an integral part of a team’s success. Although leadership is a crucial component to a team’s success, many high schools do not provide a leadership development program for their athletes. This project was developed to be an introductory leadership course for high school athletes. The curriculum is set up to work around the busy schedules of teachers, athletes, and coaches. The lessons are put together to give the athletes a foundation of leadership, as well as some practical experience throughout. The curriculum can be supplemented to an existing class or be a stand-alone class. If we are expecting our athletes to be leaders, then it is important to give them the skills necessary to succeed. Experience is said to be one of the most important teachers, including the development of leadership. High School sports have the potential to provide this hands-on training opportunity to millions of athletes. Developing leadership skills should be more of a priority in athletics, especially with the prevailing belief that everyone has the ability to learn how to lead.",Educational Leadership ; Student-athlete ; Leadership development,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/2
Warm springs national fish hatchery intake improvements,"McNeil, Chelsea M.","The Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery located in Warm Springs Oregon, is hampered with many issues that impact its effectiveness. In an effort to improve the effectiveness of the hatchery, United States Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) has expressed interest in modifying the existing intake to address a number of specific concerns. Five specific objectives have been identified to define the overall project scope. USFWS desires to provide a means to prevent frazil ice from forming on and around the hatchery intake screens, prevent sediment from collecting behind the weir and entering the hatchery intake, provide effective hatchery screening to prevent sediment, debris, and fish from entering the hatchery intake, decrease intake water temperatures during summer months, improve the intake screen cleaning system, and provide a means for effective water quality treatment to limit spikes in turbidity and therefore improving the effectiveness of the existing ultraviolet treatment.
Concept level improvements were developed to address the objectives. Site visits, interviews with hatchery staff, water quality sampling, hydrologic and hydraulic analysis were completed and record construction drawings of the hatchery were reviewed to confirm concept level improvement feasibility.
Three concept level design alternatives were developed to address the first four objectives while only preliminary water quality sampling was conducted so that separate concepts could be developed in the future to address the fifth objective, effectiveness of the existing sand filters. The concepts developed and evaluated included installation of rotary drum screens or vertical fixed plate screens to replace the existing static drum screens. In addition, the concepts included an a la carte of other options that address the objectives. Those a la carte items include; construction of a rock groin structure, weir improvements to provide an adjustable spillway, and miscellaneous utility upgrades.
From this analysis, Concept 3 - relocating the hatchery intake upstream was identified as most likely to address the objectives and is feasible given the site constraints. More analysis is needed before a recommendation can be made including collection of in-stream water temperature data and a quantification of the amount of sediment expected to accumulate near the proposed intake structure. However, it is also recommended that additional and consistent operation and maintenance at the existing intake could also provide significant improvements to address the objectives in the short term.",Hatchery ; Civil Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/1
Needs assessment of culturally relevant and sensitive domestic violence services for Native American women in a rural Northern California county,"Danis, Noelle L","In this rural northern Californian county, there are four federally recognized tribes, as well as additional non-federally recognized tribes. This county is home to a single encompassing agency that assists those in need of domestic violence services. Indigenous people seeking services have little choice, therefore it is paramount that providers incorporate concepts such as historical trauma and assist those in need with culturally relevant and sensitive services.
A needs assessment was conducted, which was comprised of two distinct parts. The first, was a case study to collect and analyze data from a focus group assembled of Native American women, who have had experiences with domestic violence services within this county. The intent of the focus group was to discern the users’ perspective of services, or why they may not have had sought out services in relation with the users’ cultural identity. Secondly, a survey of local professionals experienced with the Native American community, was conducted seeking individuals’ perspectives. This pertained to culturally sensitive treatments for Native American women.
Based on the findings of the research, it was expressed by participants that additional services are needed in the areas of advocacy, outreach education, counseling, and inclusions of the Native American community and healing practices representative of their culture.

"Considering ""disparate"" genealogies analogously a survey into the histories of peer response and their impact on current peer response practices","Gorman, Laura P","Peer response is a widely accepted pedagogical approach to teaching writing that goes unchallenged by contemporary compositionists. As a common pedagogical approach to teaching writing, there is a vast amount of scholarship written on the subject; nonetheless, there is a significant gap in the literature regarding unsuccessful narratives on peer response. For this reason, this project considers two seemingly disparate genealogies of peer response and reads them analogously. By reading two histories analogously that are typically positioned in opposition with one another, this project explores a broader definition of peer response and its purpose. The project’s analysis of peer response in these newly defined terms is revealing of the impact framing has on the implementation of peer response in classrooms. This project intends to re-visit this pedagogy as other scholars have, and examine these two histories critically in order to explore the “consequences” of the telling and re-telling of those histories.",Composition pedagogy ; Peer response ; Rhetoric and Composition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/14
Transcending language bridging language gaps in science education with drawing,"Gardner, Jacqueline J","This study seeks to find if drawing can help English Language Learning (ELL) students better understand and retain science content. Seventh and eighth grade students were given series of presentations about Pluto. Half of the students were asked to write only written notes while the other half was asked to both draw and write down notes during the presentations. Their pre and post test scores were compared to show the growth of the students’ content knowledge showing that the group that was required to both draw and write had on average higher scores than the group that only wrote in their lecture notes. The data and previous literature was used to influence the creation of a work book to be used for educational activities and trips at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California. Activities were designed to support language of both English speaking students and ELL students.

Automatic power management for instructional computers at Humboldt State University a calculation of potential energy savings and greenhouse gas emissions reductions,"Flenghi, Nicholas F","Computers consume an estimated 5,610 GWh per year in California alone. Much of that energy is consumed by computers that are not being used. In this project, detailed user login data are used to estimate the energy consumption of instructional computers at Humboldt State University (HSU) over the course of one semester. The data are also used to estimate the potential energy savings from automating the shutdown process. Potential cost savings and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions resulting from implementing an automatic-shutdown power management plan are also calculated.
There are approximately 1,000 computers used for teaching and learning purposes at HSU. In their current configuration, they consume an estimated 35.4 MWh each semester. However, 56% of that energy is wasted, powering computers that are not being used. By automatically powering down unused computers after 30 minutes of inactivity, significant energy, cost, and GHG emissions reductions could be realized. Energy consumption could be reduced by 45% or 15.9 MWh per semester, saving $1,935 in electricity costs. Consequently, GHG emissions could be reduced by four metric tons per semester, with little to no additional costs and minimal impact to users.",Other Electrical and Computer Engineering ; Power management ; Energy ; Computer ; Greenhouse gas ; Other Computer Engineering ; Efficiency ; Monitor ; Environmental Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/13

"Reintegration in a rural community strengths, barriers, and recommendations for reentry in Humboldt County","Vrtiak, Vanessa E","There is a current lack of reintegration services in rural Humboldt County, California. In an effort to understand the services available, and develop recommendations for future reentry services, I conducted focus groups and interviews with the currently incarcerated, service providers, and the formerly incarcerated. Some of the formerly incarcerated participants live in Humboldt County currently, and some have moved to other communities in the state of California. This research was conducted using a convenience sample, and snow ball sampling methods. The initial goal of this research was to promote communication between both community based service providers and those involved in the criminal justice system. My hope is that this will ease the process of reentry, and reduce the likelihood of recidivism. In addition, this research will aide in the planning and development of the new rehabilitation center for the Humboldt County Correctional Facility.

27 months of solitude a Peace Corps story,"Gordon, Christopher A","In 2014, I was sent to Colombia’s Caribbean coast to serve as an English teacher through the Peace Corps. I spent two years teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) at both the elementary and secondary levels in Colombian public school settings, which included time in both urban and rural areas. Despite many hardships and setbacks, my experience in the Peace Corps was overwhelmingly positive. By teaching the alphabet at the elementary level, and focusing on vocabulary, test-taking strategies, and reading comprehension strategies at the secondary level, I was able to make a positive impact in public schools which had previously never hosted a Peace Corps Volunteer (PCV).
This project tells the story of my experiences during the Master’s International Program beginning with my time at Humboldt State University, followed by my Pre-Service Training in Colombia. As a PCV in Colombia, I describe the four months I spent living, working, and observing English classes in a rural town, before moving to my final site placement. I then describe the remainder of my first year of service co-teaching at the primary-school level, as well as my second year of service co-teaching at the secondary-school level. I also include a description of my community English class, and my after-school English club. More specifically, this M.A. project describes the activities that worked in the classroom as a result of my TEFL training, as well as the activities that did not work in the classroom, often due to the cultural context of teaching on the Colombian coast. Additionally, this M.A. project discusses what I now believe I would do differently after having had some time for reflection.
The final portion of my M.A. project describes my experience with different secondary projects including a photography camp, music lessons, and a skateboarding group. My aim is that readers will be inspired by my journey to join the Peace Corps, and that future Peace Corps Volunteers will learn about the rewards that come with finishing one’s service.",Teaching English as Foreign Language ; MIP ; TEFL ; TESL ; HSU ; Colombia ; Humboldt State University ; Other English Language and Literature ; Peace Corps ; Masters International Program,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/9

"Assessment of individual photovoltaic module performance after 26 years of field exposure at the Telonicher Marine Lab in Trinidad, California","Rada, Jake","In 1990, 192 ARCO M75 photovoltaic (PV) modules were installed as a part of the Schatz Solar Hydrogen Project at the Humboldt State University (HSU) Telonicher Marine Lab in Trinidad, California, within 150 m of the Pacific Ocean. This 9.2 kW-rated PV array was used to power the marine laboratory air compressor and an electrolyzer. Individual current-voltage (IV) curve tests were performed on each of the PV modules prior to the array’s construction in 1990 and again in 2001, 2010, and, most recently, in 2016, following decommissioning of the array. After 25.5 years of use, 188 of the original 192 modules were operational, significantly outliving their 10-year warranties.
Based on the previous testing results and the 2016 results, the lifetime decline in the maximum power output, at the normal operating cell temperature (NOCT) testing conditions of 1000 W/m2 of solar insolation and 47°C module temperature, of the modules averaged 21.6%, or 8.6 W, with 47% of the modules still producing at least 80% of their original (1990) measured maximum power. The average rate of the power output degradation grew from 0.4%/year in the first decade to 1.4%/year in the second decade, and the average degradation rate over the 25.5 years of exposure came to 0.85%/year.",modules ; Photovoltaic ; Semiconductor and Optical Materials ; Environmental Engineering ; Trinidad Marine Lab ; Telonicher Marine Lab ; Power degradation ; Civil Engineering ; SERC ; PV testing ; Degradation ; PV,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/7
Equine assisted learning with special populations,"Baus, Hanna R","This paper explores the use of equine-assisted learning (EAL) activities with special populations and includes a program evaluation for two equine-assisted learning programs developed and conducted by HeartStrides, a non-profit organization in the Pacific Northwest. The study included two populations (N=18); the at-risk youth program included seven participants and the veterans’ clinic included eleven participants. For the purpose of this study, the participating youth are considered “at-risk” due to their risk factors that include socioeconomic status, exposure to stressful and traumatic events (physical, sexual, and/or psychological abuse), neglect, dysfunctional parenting, substance abuse in the home, self-harming tendencies and/or suicidal thoughts or actions. I conducted quantitative analysis on the pre- and post-survey results for both groups, and qualitative analysis on the veterans’ group survey. The results indicated the EAL activities had a positive impact on the at-risk youths’ resilience, hope, agency and pathways to higher thinking scores. The results showed a positive impact on the veterans’ ability to cope with stress after the completion of the clinic. The results indicate implementation of these activities may have a positive impact on participants’ stress and coping skills. Findings from the analyses suggest these programs at HeartStrides are having the desired effect on participants. Based on the results of this study, and a growing body of literature on the impacts of equine-based programming on various populations, I propose utilizing EAL activities with the formerly incarcerated population in hopes of achieving similar results. Overall, this study adds to research about equine-assisted programs, such as those offered through HeartStrides and other potentially effective EAL programs for an array of special populations.",At-risk youth ; Pacific Northwest ; Community-Based Research ; Veterans ; Equine therapy,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/5

Reliability and validity of a modified anaerobic speed test to determine anaerobic capacity in NCAA division II soccer players,"Murao, Kenji","Anaerobic capacity is an important performance variable for soccer athletes to compete at higher levels of competition. The purpose of this study was to develop a sports-specific anaerobic capacity test for soccer players that could be administered on commercial treadmills found in most exercise facilities. The Wingate Anaerobic test (WAnT) is the most common test for anaerobic capacity, however it is a cycle ergometer test, which is not sports-specific to running type athletes. The Anaerobic Speed Test (AST) is an anaerobic capacity test on a treadmill, however the testing protocol (20% incline) cannot be done on commercial treadmills because they have a maximum incline setting of 15%. The modified Anaerobic Speed Test (mAST) protocol (15% incline, 244 meter/min) was developed through the use of an ACSM metabolic equation to predict energy expenditure equivalent to that of the AST. 15 subjects playing soccer at the NCAA Division II level participated in this study. Subjects participated in three testing days, one AST trial and two mAST trials all done on separate days. Total run time in seconds was recorded for each trial.

Abjection in late nineteenth century British literature,"Imholte, Robin A","In this project, I examine three major British works of literature produced in the last two decades of the nineteenth century: Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Oscar Wilde’s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure. I show that these works reflect popular trends and fears that arose during this time, including notions of decadence and fears of degeneration. Using Julia Kristeva’s conception of abjection, as described in her work Powers of Horror, I argue that developments throughout the Victorian era: namely the advent of the theory of evolution, the rise and expansion of large-scale industrialization, and the moral and economic benefits and ramifications of global colonization, ultimately led to social and individual insecurities that reverberated throughout popular literature of the time. I conclude that these cultural attitudes and insecurities can be seen reflected in works of literature and in their depiction of characters and behaviors whose self-abjection are a reflection of a society with an unstable self-image.",Imperialism ; Theory ; Abjection ; Psychoanalysis ; Victorian Period ; Nineteenth Century ; English ; Literature in English ; English Literature ; English Language and Literature ; British Isles ; Gothic,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/projects/17
Levee stories for an expedited reconnaissance study,"Bromley, Kathleen C","The coordination of earthen levees in Humboldt County, California known as the Redwood Creek Flood Control Project holds mistakes within its design and composition. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) admitted in studies conducted after the sculpture’s completion in 1968 that the levees extended too far into the creek’s estuary and this overreach has yet to be corrected. Poorly negotiated allowances of the levees into the transition zone caused the circulation of the vital water vein to compromise proper supportive nourishment for ecologic health. Economies such as fishing, farming, education and tourism surrounding the waterway have also suffered. Other complexities involved with the levees transmogrify several broader plots of development found thru the arrangements of actions. This research project used ethnographic methods to gather different lines of narrative around the flood control project to advocate for change. In directing heteroglossia analysis with supportive multimodal anthropology, the objective was to reveal the stratagems of the levee system observed as an oeuvre thru its stories that, woven together, compose the significance of the edifice. With this accomplished, the agencies involved can efficiently assign the task of remediation. Methodological triangulation indicated poisonous Lead (Pb) might remain within the ground of the public work.

To Japan and Back The Art of Orr Marshall,"Marshall, Orr","How many ways are there to interpret an idea, to present a vision? The artist Orr Marshall's exploration of these questions is the subject of this book in text and images. Like most children, he began drawing pictures as soon as he could hold a pencil or a crayon, depicting the weird creatures of his imagination. He maintained a concentration on art through school, majoring in painting at Yale School of Art and Architecture where Josef Albers was his most inspiring teacher. Another interest of his was language study, especially Japanese and Chinese with their writing systems and calligraphy. He taught art in the San Francisco area, where he continued learning those languages. Then with a scholarship from the Japanese government he went to the National University of the Arts in Tokyo to study for a year and a half.
Orr Marshall finds inspiration in many places—especially in imagination and dreams; also in everyday surroundings when he sees promising source material. Ranging in technique from realism to semi-abstraction, he challenges himself further with questions and goals such as:   Could he paint entirely in patterns of colored dots yet retain a recognizable subject? Could he depict nudes—essentially curvilinear—made entirely of squares and rectangles of varied sizes? Could he turn the amorphous dreams of his mind's eye into something solid and believable for all to see? As a Westerner, could he mix scenes of modern Japan with traditional imagery, labeled with names of places and characters (including his signature) in various styles of Japanese calligraphy? 
These are a few examples of his approaches to art that require extensive preparatory sketches, drawings, paintings, to figure out how to do them. Along the way, through his trial studies he often discovers new ideas, new color combinations, leading him to yet other works. So he goes on creating, spurred by a constant flow of inspiration. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reprint/1007/thumbnail.jpg",Sculpture ; Painting ; Interdisciplinary Arts and Media,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reprint/6

In 2019, a special partnership with Ink People Center for the Arts, North Coast Open Studios, HSU’s Art Department, Crescent City Art, and the Trinity County Arts Council led to local North Coast artists decorating more than 100 3-foot-tall otter sculptures. The sculptures were displayed at shops, galleries, schools, and other North Coast locations. The auction delivered the otter sculptures to permanent homes, with the proceeds funding future otter studies and student internships with community-based watershed projects.
The Otter Spotter Activities Booklet authored by Anna Spitzer, Natalie Sanman, Isabelle Otillio, Joshua Overington, Brissa Christophersen, Sarah Duffy, Brighton Hayashida, Jennifer L. Tarlton and Jeffrey M. Black is also available above for download. The booklet invites you join in the fun and learn about our North Coast Otters.

"Environmental History and Cultural Ecology of the North Fork of the Eel River Basin, California","Keter, Thomas S.","In this publication, baseline data on the regions environment during the ethnographic period are formulated through what can best be termed ""environmental reconstruction."" That is, through historical research, interviews with local residents, and on-the-ground observations, a model of the regions environment prior to the entry ofEuroAmericans into the area is documented. Paleoclimatic and pollen core-data are then integrated with these baseline data to formulate a diachronic catchment model (accounting for the variable or dimension of time) of the region for the prehistoric period. In effect, this catchment analysis delineates the potential resource base and procurement opportunities available to the aboriginal population through time and in a changing environment. The purpose of such a model is to permit researchers, as Richard Gould (1975:153) writes, to ""examine the universe of edible resources in the region from the point of view of how human beings must organize their ·movements, technology, and social groups in order to collect them effectively."" The catchment analysis is followed by an overview outlined in the North Fork catchment analysis and of the ethnographic data for the region about the the ethnographic record, the final part of this study kinds of natural resources utilized by the Wailaki presents some suggestions on potential prehistoric and Lassik, who inhabited the region during the late site settlement patterning and the kinds of sites prehistoric period. In light of the resource base likely to be found in the North Fork region. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reprint/1011/thumbnail.jpg",Eel River ; Humboldt County ; Pacific Southwest ; California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reprint/10

Redwood Roots Stories of Community Engagement at HSU,"Center for Community Based Learning, HSU","Welcome to the inaugural edition of Humboldt State University’s Redwood Roots magazine. When we came up with the idea for this magazine, we wanted to highlight the many wonderful ways that students, faculty and community partners are engaging in community-based learning practices in and around Humboldt County. This project was a huge endeavor and we are grateful to our partners, both ongoing, such as the HSU Library Press team and the shorter term partners that donated their time to submit articles, develop the concept and layout for this magazine, and their many other contributions. We began this project in the fall of 2018 and are extremely proud to have it launch in the spring of 2020.
In the last year and a half, we have had numerous discussions about the format, purpose, content, and direction of the magazine. What we could not have en-visioned was that our target timeframe to launch would be amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We briefly discussed transitioning this edition to relay what was happening during COVID-19. We decided, however, to continue with our original plan for this spring and focus our fall 2020 edition on the many creative ways that community-based learning practices were able to continue in a remote and rapidly changing environment. So, enjoy this original edition and look for our fall edition that will highlight HSU’s amazing students, faculty and community partners and how they came together (virtually) in a time of crisis to positively impact the students’ education and the community we live in and love",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/rr/vol1/iss1/1

The Power of a Podcast,"Donlon, Breanna","This paper examines the correlation between the Your Own Backyard podcast and the rebooting of the Kristin Smart missing persons case. This case had gone cold and seemingly ignored for nearly 25 years, until 2019 when the podcast was created. The host conducted immense amounts of research to try and figure out what happened to Kristin, and in doing so, brought her case back to to the public’s attention. The actions of the podcast host caused the police to become more active on the case again. Because of the podcast, the prime suspect was finally arrested and will be held on trial.
Podcasting has become such a prevalent part of our media intake, with an even bigger impact on us than we might think. Podcasting seems to be becoming a very powerful form of communication. To examine this, we will focus on the history of podcasting, with the intent to show how podcasting can now be considered a form of journalism. Additionally, we will compare printed media with podcast media and how they differ when it comes to bringing awareness to missing persons cases.",Communication ; Journalism ; True Crime ; Podcasting ; Kristin Smart,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/23
Communication Classes That Help With Employment,"Savin, Cole","The reasoning for this paper is to influence you to take communication classes not only for credits or units for your major, but to further your knowledge, skills, and experience as a person. To start off this paper I talk about an interview with a manager about interviews and resumes. Then I talk about all of the communication classes that you can take and how it helps. These communication classes that are mentioned in this paper will help you the most in your employment wherever that may be. This paper will go over what employers look for in you as well as what will help you during employment. I will also talk about 4 skills that you will learn when taking communication classes (problem solving skills, the ability to work in a team setting, communication skills, and adaptability). The Communication classes that will be vital to take are Communication 490, Communication 206 Group communication, Communication 110 public speaking, Communication 120 and 322 intercultural communication, and Communication 324 nonverbal communication. There are many more classes that you can take and all of them will help. The communication department is willing to help you with your future and are very nice. Making the communication major an all around great choice in a major.",Communication ; Communication For The Work Place,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/8
Shifting A Culture,"Arjomand, Ardeshir J","What is popular culture and how does it influence us? How can we be more critically aware consumers of media messages? Are we always ""online"", or is there some way we can disconnect? These are the questions I've attempted to define through my research and experience studying contemporary ""pop culture"". Consider this a beginner’s guide on how to become aware of and deal with the constant bombardment of media messages, and how to become a filter for content, rather than a sponge. As critical consumers of media we can cater our consumption to better suit our needs and lifestyles. This paper was mainly intended to raise awareness, but also to motivate and inspire us to: disconnect from the noise of society, to get out in nature, and to be positive role models for future generations. I’ve come to the conclusion that you can never fully disconnect, but we can get close if we really try. The important thing is to find a healthy balance, once we become aware of the pervasiveness of media influence in our lives.",Communication ; Mass ; Culture ; Popular ; Media ; Influence,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/17
Like a Virgin Comparing Cross-Cultural Virginity,"Tejada, Anastasia M","Studies have been conducted about the social construct of virginity inside the United States and cross-culturally. Investigations comparing the United States with these other cultures are limited and focus on the United States as the ideal representation of virginity in men and women. I aim to expand upon the current research provided by adding a new perspective to the analysis. The objective of conducting this analysis is to provide a global perspective defining the connotations of virginity cross-culturally. This study focused on the cultural, religious, and societal impacts on virginity collected through qualitative methods in the cultures of Arab-Americans, Latinx-Americans, and Malawi villages. The concluding evidence supported the theory that although there are specific gender expectations tied to each culture’s version of virginity, in an overarching analysis, the core ideals are too similar to be ignored.

A History Cannabis as a Cultural Communication Artifact,"Harper, Morgan L","This essay aims to detail the mechanics, structure, history, and ideology of cannabis from a socio-cultural perspective within the United States. However, it does contain some content that I believe will correlate with an international perspective. My emphasis in conducting this research is to look at the ways in which cannabis acts as a societal communication artifact, and in doing so, how it has formed a vast and highly identifiable culture. I believe that Cannabis acts as a communication tool both socially and interpersonally, with both notions being equally important to the culture overall. Cannabis has language, looks, and sounds, that come along with it, and these are vital aspects of what makes cannabis a communicative culture. With the recent societal advances in cannabis becoming widely decriminalized and regulated, the cannabis industry is moving from the hills to board room and consumer demographics are broad as ever. I am interested in exploring the ways in which the social and cultural component of cannabis was developed and how this has shifted and evolved, all while staying relatively true to its roots.",Communication ; Artifact ; Subculture ; Culture ; Cannabis ; Socio-Cultural,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/30
Countercultural Representation,"McGriff, Ethan A","Counter cultures have been prevalent throughout modern American history. Accompanied with music, these movements break the barriers of time and live on. Starting with an anecdote, the rapper Lil peep is given as an example of what the movements and music has led up to. To highlight modern movements that lead to that, the flower power movement is given first light. This leads into the punk/ hip-hop era, which gives way for the emocore movement that ultimately defines what our current generation considers to be the counterculture. Movements and music change over time and along the way people get hurt. Essentially music that aligns itself with a movement starts as counter cultural and gains mainstream popularity where it gets sold to death and gives birth to a new genre.",Punk ; Music ; Communication ; Emocore ; Counterculture ; Intercultural Communication ; Flower Power ; Cultural Artifact,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/3
"Children’s Film Media’s Influence on Gender, Race, and Identity","Kovis, Sara M","Whether conscious of it or not, media images have been working our entire lives to construct our attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of the world around us. What is the significance of the relationship between media consumption and how we interact in society? Applying communication theories and research into traditional and digital media is vital in understanding the realities around us. It explains where societal norms and values stimulate and how they trigger new behavioral changes. Ideologies are the mixed concepts and elements that create meaning in society. Today, people's ideological feelings produce pre-dated ideologies rather than their ideas. These are formed unconsciously by other social foundations, like their environment and the media, that surround and shape them. Not only does the media play a significant role in the views of others, but it is also a basis for forming our identities and place in a social context. Enculturation, first coined by anthropologist William Ogburn, is ""the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary to that culture and its worldviews"" (Enculturation, Google Arts & Culture, 2022). Today, enculturation and information about cultures other than one's own are first introduced to children through the media.",Critical and Cultural Studies ; Communication ; Gender ; Worldview's ; Male-gaze ; Cultivation Theory ; Racial Representation ; Communication Technology and New Media ; Symbolic Annihilation ; Gender Norms ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; Children's Media ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Enculturation ; Race,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/31
Stereotyping Gender Roles Children's Commercial Advertisement,"McClelland, Lucky J","Heteronormativity gives the individual in our society a binary optional choice: the first choice being the socially accepted ‘norm’ that follows the heteronormative binary, and the second being the socially disfavored choice of being deemed ‘abnormal’ if one chooses to go against this heteronormative binary. In return, we as a socially constructed society then deem the binary option of the ‘norm’ as the culturally preferred ‘good’ choice, while at the same time deem the other binary option of the ‘abnormal’ as the socially constructed ‘bad’ choice. This occurs both intentionally and unintentionally. The purpose behind my area of focus is to identify that the binary stereotyping of heteronormative gender roles in children’s commercial advertisement is resulting in young children having an essentialized heteronormative embedded ideology. With children’s commercial advertisements exclusively representing the heteronormative non-intersectional gender role narratives, this identity exclusion is leading children to reject any form of intersectional identity that doesn’t fit in the heteronormative binary bracket, as a subordinate socially ostracized form of gender and or sex identity for a child not to follow.",Gender ; Communication ; Intersectionality ; Stereotype ; Heteronormativity ; Advertisement ; Children,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/6
Healthy Environmental Communication Practices,"Magana, Michelle Monique","The goal of my academic research is to highlight the importance of appropriate, scientifically correct and accurate communication when discussing Environmental Health. If we want to begin making changes to help our environment to become more sustainable and ultimately provide more years of existence we must stop the lies, propaganda and spread of misinformation. “Communication constructs a social world that is relational, collaborative, strategic, symbolic, and adaptive” (Learning Outcomes in Communication). The objective is to understand the discourse on environmental issues and try to use our communication discipline to engage and dissect this issue from a Communication perspective. Our standards when talking about environmental issues should be high due to the severity. Recognizing discourse and critically analyzing the messages we are consuming on climate change is important for our own interpretation. As for writers with any type of platform it is our responsibility to create accurate messages for audiences to absorb and make sense of. When communicating about the environment our ethical principles and values should be present. As a society it is very important to practice sharing knowledgeable information to provide truth. Political gain and financial gain should be stopped when compromising our environmental health. We can make a difference if we work to disrupt this discourse and use academia to help save our planet. It is unethical to destroy a whole civilization’s environment for private financial gain. All humans will suffer the consequences of this discourse one day if we do not aim to be accurate and appropriate when communicating about environmental health.",Communication ; communication	 environmental health		 public discourse	 rhetoric 	 media literacy		environmental justice,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/21
Academy of the Redwoods,"Detrick, Kasey J","In this academic research paper I will be analyzing the procedures and practices of the high school that I attended, Academy of the Redwoods. Academy of the Redwoods is an early college preparatory high school located amongst the redwoods in Eureka, California. It was a very different school in comparison to average high schools around the country and thus, a unique experience. Therefore, I will be comparing the dynamics of Academy of the Redwoods in conjunction to normal high schools using academic journals and sources. Some of the areas that I focus on are the school atmosphere and student life, advantages and disadvantages of attending early college high schools, attending college courses as a teenager, and class sizes. I also talk about the relationship between Academy of the Redwoods and the community college that it exists on, College of the Redwoods. Additionally, I will be looking at Academy of the Redwoods using theoretical communication approaches such as human relations approach, organizational culture, bureaucracy, organizational communication, and the systems perspective.",Early College High School ; Academy of the Redwoods ; Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/12
"Bisexuality, Intersectionality, and the Bechdel Test in Jane the Virgin","Mallory, Catherine E, Ms.","Abstract
For this project I have looked at the show Jane the Virgin through a critical lens, and analyzed the characters in the show, the stereotypes portrayed about Latino culture, the stereotypes towards bisexuality, how intersectionality is involved, and the Bechdel-Wallace test. Throughout this paper I will examine a few specific characters and look at how stereotypes, of certain kinds, are portrayed, and how others are completely turned on it’s head. I apply terms such as intersectionality, stereotype, and sexuality to the characters and what they go through, throughout the course of the show. I have found that there are a few characters that represent the bi-sexual community, others from the LGBTQIA++ community, and discuss how they are shown positively in the show. I also use a critical cultural lens and look at common stereotypes that are made about the Latino culture, and how this show applies many of them, but also shows characters fighting those stereotypes and proving that not everyone from this culture fits those assumptions.",Communication ; Gender ; Bechdel Test ; Intersectionality ; Telenovela ; Stereotypes,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/20
I’m Not a Tragedy Speaking Up About Ableist Microaggressions,"Colwell, Kasandra Marguerite","Have you heard of ableist microaggressions? Let me tell you about them, as someone who has experienced them. I have a bi-lateral dislocating knee condition that I was born with. I can walk, but sometimes I need additional stability or reduction of pain while getting around, in which case I tend to use a cane. I have had many othering interactions while using a mobility aid in public, whether that be a knee brace, a cane, or crutches. While it often seemed the stranger didn’t mean any harm, the question is how many invasive questions and comments from strangers can one person take? Do they even listen to the response? I notice the different ways I’m treated depending on the visibility or invisibility of my disability. In this paper I will tell stories of some of these interactions during a time when my disability was more visible, and I connect these stories to ableist microaggressions domains and experiences shared in previous research. This paper will take a different route than most academic papers, opting instead for a narrative approach. Considering these are deeply personal experiences, it feels better to tell my story in this way.",microaggressions ; chronic pain ; disability visibility ; Other Mental and Social Health ; Other Theatre and Performance Studies ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication ; mental health ; Disability Studies ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Mental and Social Health ; Critical and Cultural Studies ; ableism ; physical disability ; Liberal Studies ; Creative Writing ; Communication ; Nonfiction ; personal narrative ; Social Psychology and Interaction ; Performance Studies ; Medical Education ; Other Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/27
Challenges Faced by Recently Emancipated Youth,"Peña, Williams ; Butkiewicz, Jerry Walter, III","In this academic research paper, we will be exploring the challenges faced by recently emancipated youth. We chose this topic because of the fact that this is not often spoken about or taught to the general public. This lack of attention to these issues creates hurdles when attempting to solve these sensitive issues. Considering this, we thought it would be a strong choice for further research and review. We explored many obstacles these new adults face. One such issue that we would like to touch on is the unstable housing situation of these recently emancipated individuals. Another prudent example is the issue of healthcare. While some support systems are in place, more should be done in the form of education of these valuable resources available. In layman's terms, foster children have their basic needs covered by the state until the day they turn 18. On their 18th birthday, they are considered adults and can no longer be supported under the foster care system. This is not a system that caters to the success of foster children, this is a system that does the bare minimum. Let's explore how we can do better for foster children and subsequently be better as a society.",Foster Care System ; Communication ; Vulnerable Youth ; Independent Living Programs ; Aging Out ; Foster Youth ; Social Work ; Emancipation ; Health Communication ; Mentorship ; Health Care ; Social Welfare ; Public Affairs ; Homelessness ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication ; Transitional Housing Programs,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/26
The Cost for Our Entertainment,"Younger, Jasmine","Abstract
Sports hold such a dominant role in our society. They provide entertainment for individuals, job opportunities, and have a great impact on any given communities’ economy. However, we as the consumers and fans of the industry, tend to lack further examinations on the dynamics of the economic roles within sports. We sometimes become caught up in the glory of sports and never truly take the time to examine all of the money that goes into the industry. This paper will illustrate the ways in which the sports industry disburses their funds. From the cost of being a fan, to the payments of athletes, and the roles that sports economics play in a professional sports team’s community as a whole. It will then further question whether or not sports are too costly for our own pure enjoyment/entertainment.",Fans ; Communication ; Stadiums ; Economies ; Sports ; Athletes ; COVID-19 ; Finances ; Sports Industry ; Costs,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/4
Parenting in the Public Eye,"Stauff, Sarah","This paper examines how parents share photos, videos and information about their children on social media websites, called sharenting. COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act is mentioned specifically because it does not protect children’s online presence from their parents. Multiple types of sharenting are examined such as; posts for family and friends to view, informational blogs and posts, punishment posts, and YouTube vlogging, or blogging in a video format. Vlogging is dissected by studying three different family vlog YouTube channels and the content that they create. The confidence and sense of self worth of children whose parents participate in sharenting is discussed as well as both present and future repercussions of these posts. Additionally, threats to children’s safety are looked at from how schools, activities and addresses are sometimes available to find on parent’s profiles on websites like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. As well as safety risks, there are often risks of bullying for the child because of the often sensitive nature of these posts. All of these have the potential to be very detrimental to children and their emotional development.

HSU Communicative Practices Administration Must Include the Student Voice,"Medina, Q","This paper examines the impact of communication practices of university administration (openness and inclusion) on the student body’s sense of satisfaction, value, and connectedness by focusing on a selected collection of past moments of communication from administration to students. A total of five current instances where official emails were sent out addressing a handful of the biggest impactful events at the university and the following reactions from the overall student body was used as the qualitative data to analyze the effectiveness of such communication choices. Results of the observations confirmed that the current practices of the university administration were no longer considered wholly acceptable or consistent with the values not only claimed by the university, but also those expressed and attached to the student body identity. More importantly, they showed the clear need for more value and inclusion to be put on student voices regarding big events and decisions made by administrators. The study concludes with the implications of what path the current practices will lead Humboldt State University if not addressed and altered to match the current organizational culture and environment.",Bureaucracy ; Communication ; Administration ; Organizational Communication ; HSU culture ; Organizational communication ; University administration ; Leadership Studies ; Organization Development ; Student voices ; Humboldt State University ; Student culture,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/19
Ripe for Consumption Separating Women from Autonomy,"Stibbard, Nicole Kasandra","This proposed position statement privileges the notion that the male gaze is a damning and damaging force for identifying women in both Western societies as well as within patriarchal societies. This particular exploration is driven by my perceived lack of the true effect that this gaze has socially and intrapersonally over women. The male gaze not only strips women of bodily integrity, bodily autonomy, but autonomy holistically. Beyond the stripping of autonomous worth, the male gaze, i.e. objectification and an autonomous reduction to body parts alone, all result in psychological and physiological damage for identifying women. Previous research in the Communication field focuses on the explicitness of women’s appearances and the drive for objectification and the male gaze to occur; therefore, how and what objectification creates for women’s realities is extremely neglected. In order to properly challenge, and hopefully dismantle: heteropatriarchy, heteropolarity, and heteronormativity which all motivate objectification, women’s reality via the male gaze requires more study to deduce the exact ways in which such objectification could and should be challenged. The aforementioned negative and damaging effects of the male gaze are: belief in rape myths and other anti-women myths relating to violence, bodily surveillance, body monitoring, self-objectification, anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and more. It will require continual autoethnographic accounts from identifying women to gather more of these effects. This form of research and account has the potential to free some anticipation and anxiety surrounding the feelings of isolation which may come from enduring such an oppressive force alone.",Communication ; Heteropatriarchy ; Heteronormativity ; Objectification ; Heteropolarity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/22

Consumerism and Covid - 19  A Neoliberal Analysis,"Roy, Taylor M","This paper attempts to draw a line between consumer culture and COVID -19, while finding how it has been influenced by social media and targeted advertisements. Through exploring Foucault's understanding of neoliberalism and the homoeconomicus, articles and media news, this paper will have assessed the changes of consumer culture due to the “shelter in place” orders. Additionally, it will attempt to redefine Foucaults homoeconomicus to fit this new model as well as observe how electronic surveillance through social media platforms and their targeted ads will or have changed the landscape of neoliberalism. In summarizing the notable differences in the use of individuals' online presence versus the older model of focus groups we will see that society is providing immeasurable numbers of free labor hours. By analysing all of these different avenues, this paper will attempt to create predictions for what this “new” neoliberalism will look like not only for the current climate but what this will imply for the neoliberal climate of the future - that is the world we will be living in when things go back to “normal”.

"Mankind, Humans, Congressman It’s All Inclusive, Right Guys?","Thacker, Rachael","This paper takes a look at research surrounding the use of gendered language and how it impacts occupations and careers from ages as young as grade school, and all the way into adulthood. The use of gender-fair language creates a more gender inclusive attitude towards traditionally male occupations. The masculine generic language used in our culture perpetuates gender stereotypes among children as young as six and continues on into adulthood. Changing the language to include both women and men allows for both to self-identify beyond the stereotypical occupations and see themselves as successful. This can be seen in how children view occupations as gendered, in whether or not women apply for job advertisements that use masculine generic language, and even in the job itself when the job relies on students evaluating a teacher’s performance. Self-identification is important in regards to success, and language plays a role in this. Even gender-fair language is not fully inclusive as it reinforces the binary and causes erasure in marginalized groups such as the trans community or someone who identifies as nonbinary. Language is a powerful tool to uphold current power structures and make privileged bodies hyper visible.",Binary ; Gender ; Communication ; Masculine generic language ; Gender-fair language ; Work ; Occupation ; Normative language ; Stereotypes,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/15
"Non-Verbal Communication, Anxiety, Behavioral Changes within Covid Regulatory Changes","Stack, Sydney ; McCracken, Olivia","In the current era of education and social communication shifting into a virtual world the students entering the early elementary education system have experienced something that is new to all of us. Within the last two and a half years life as we have known it has vastly shifted. Virtual learning and communication, which is not something that is new, but something that was scarce prior to the Covid-19 pandemic is now the “new normal.” For many of the students affected, this way of learning has shaped much of their educational career. Changes like these are affecting areas of development within these young students; such as the development of their nonverbal communication, the increase of anxiety, alongside behavioral shifts. Throughout this paper we will be discussing and analyzing the current research and data alongside these new protocols, as well as their effects in the short term on those who are most vulnerable. Some of the new protocols and overall changes that we will be looking into are the use of masking, social distancing, distance learning, and the increase in screen time. Above all, the questions we are going to be looking at are: Have these changes affected early elementary students, and has it created limitations within their nonverbal communication, and increasing anxiety?

The Misrepresentation of Women in the Media and Women’s Rights,"Endicott, Hannah M","This paper is centered around the misrepresentation of women in the media and the implications that it has had on the treatment of women’s rights in society. The media is defined as television, movies, advertisements, etc. Women have been represented as being oversimplified through their stereotypical portrayal as housewives and mothers in the media, alongside being hypersexualized through their clothing and body image. Both of these forms of portrayals have had negative effects on women. Young girls are now being targeted as well through the explicit tones that the advertising of children’s toys creates. This paper aims to demonstrate how women have been disadvantaged through their stereotypical portrayal in the media and the ways in which that has led to their rights being disregarded in society. The overturning of the legal case Roe v. Wade is a prime example used in this paper to demonstrate a direct way in which women have been disadvantaged and the ways that their portrayals in the media may have led to this. This paper also aims to convince society that changes must be made to the ways that we show women in the media.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/33

Interpersonal Communication From Student to Host Family,"Magee, Tajma R","This research project aims to improve interpersonal communication between international students and their host families. Existing research and data shows that students can have a difficult time adjusting to their life abroad, whether it be within their host home or within the institution they are studying at. This can greatly affect their overall studying abroad experience and can affect the way they communicate with the members of their host family. Factors like the student’s academic performance in school and behavior in school may be affected as well. Identifying the issues that contribute to a negative experience in a host family’s home will provide study abroad programs, institutions connected with study abroad programs, host families and the international students themselves with the tools they need that are necessary to improve the overall communication within a host family and international student home. I will collect data from students in the California State University system studying abroad in three different locations: Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. I will also present a proposed questionnaire that would need to get approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if I actually went through with this plan, I will include the link to the website to get that done below. My initial research showed that these are the most popular study abroad destinations among college students in California. I will dig in deep to track and identify the positive and negative elements of the study abroad experience that affect the behavior and communication between the international students and their host family. I will look into the students that returned from the program as well. This method will provide a deeper, more personable understanding of what aspects of the program, from the student’s perspective, and can be improved to increase the communication between these two parties. This collection of data, with recommendations, will be given to the California State University system, the international programs, and the participating host families in hopes of improving the quality of the travel abroad experience for international CSU students, and more specifically the communication they have with their host family.",Communication ; Sojourner ; Organizational Competence ; Pragmatic Competence ; Schema Theory ; Imagined Community,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/28

A Critical Analysis of Mobile Interpersonal Relationships through Uncertainty Reduction Theory,"Kee, Rachael L","Through the use of online dating apps, individuals are having the chance to begin, develop, and end interpersonal relationships without ever even meeting the partner in person. It is assumed that this is happening due to the lack of primary tension in initial contact, as uncertainty reduction can take place from behind a screen. This study sought to connect the theories between Uncertainty Reduction Theory and mobile interpersonal relationships. The axioms of Charles Berger’s theory come into play during online dating as the eight key variables of relationship development are utilized in most successful interpersonal relationships to further intimacy, in an attempt to reduce primary tension. To further connect, four information-seeking strategies can be utilized during the online dating experience as people have the ability to observe online interaction, seek information from a third party online source, talk directly to the person of interest, and browse the internet for information about them as well. Through these primary connections between URT and mobile interpersonal relationships, areas of interest for further research can be actions towards comparing those who reduce uncertainty in an online platform versus those who do in-person in a longitudinal study.",Communication ; Primary tension ; Mobile ; Online-dating ; Uncertainty reduction theory ; Interpersonal relationships,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/32
Group Involvement Cohesion & Tensions through Collaboration,"Hernandez, Edwin","The importance of teamwork and group involvement is essential not only in school to complete a common goal, but employers need to know that you have cooperation skills and the ability to collaborate with others in a diverse setting effectively. As my roommates and I arrived from different parts of California into a rural small county called Humboldt, we all came for the environment, but perhaps for distinctively altered reasons. We looked to develop improved relationships as well as group communication within the confines of our living space. Additionally, the goal was to maintain and manage a clean environment within our dorm room. For some of us, it's the first time living alone without our parents, however, we don't have them to clean up after ourselves anymore. Even though we each have our separate rooms, sharing and cleaning the kitchen, as well as the bathrooms, have already created certain tensions within our group.
The purpose of this research is to investigate how individuals within the collegiate academic level form relationships amongst their roommates. We are all different in our personal characteristics, however, the end goal is to maintain and manage a clean environment. With each passing day, we learn more from each other whether it’s flaws, skills, or strengths. We, in a sense, are forced to live with each other. Getting to know my roommates has been interesting. Each person is different and unique in their way. To co-exist in tranquility and create a safe space, we need to understand the importance of roles.

"Data Capitalism, Digital Health, and Marxism","Stanger, Samantha C","Abstract
When immersed in a capitalist society individuals often fail to see the ways in which they are exploited, and when these discussions do come into discourse they are often geared toward workplace labor. Less commonly do we consider the ways in which these problems arise in conjunction with free labor, mainly performed in digital spaces. While less often considered or discussed, the exploitation occurring in the digital world is real and has substantial consequences, particularly when the digital spaces involve sensitive information and data.  This paper aims to address how data capitalism functions in three different digital health spaces: online patient forums and support groups, mental health apps, and direct-to-consumer DNA sequencing companies. In order to show how patients are persuaded to join and contribute to these digital spaces there will be an investigation of the rhetorical strategies utilized in marketing tactics. We will consider the economic functioning of data capitalism through a basic Marxist perspective, which criticized the capitalist mode of production and exploitation of workers, or in this case the creators of data.",Communication ; capitalism ; marketing ; Direct-to-consumer genome sequencing ; free labor ; rhetoric,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/25
Dissecting Ideologies Embedded in Ford Advertisement,"Afsarzadeh, Sidney Rain Shabnam","The goal of this paper is to exemplify rhetorical criticism to examine an artifact. Specifically, this paper will use the method of ideological criticism to identify ideologies embedded in a commercial. In the case of this paper, the commercial being examined is a Ford truck commercial titled, Ford for the Builders, Built for America. This paper will identify and explain the ideologies used to advertise Ford trucks. It is important to be able to identify ideologies embedded in things like commercials in order to not be blind to cultivation theory. Which is a theory created by Professor George Gerber in the 1960s. Overall, the goal is to identify messages which are communicated through advertisement. Ford is one of the original American businesses and every person in this country who has been around television and or the internet has seen their ads. This paper will identify the meanings they are trying to portray with their ads. Along with why they would choose to communicate those ideologies in their advertisement. When a person is able to identify ideologies being portrayed by someone or something else they can be less affected by them. Moreover, this paper may teach a reader how to embed meaning into their own rhetoric by comprehending the dissecting of rhetoric.",Communication ; Ideological Criticism ; Ford ; Cultivation Theory,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/29
Representation in Animation,"Benoit, Michelle L","In this paper I’m addressing what is missing in representation in films today. I take the shows Avatar: The Last Airbender, Steven Universe and Fairy Tail to explain what proper representation should look like in the media. I look at this with the perspective of rhetoric as a communication major. Providing my comment on the shows. I’m examining this show with three factors. Do they have women in roles of leadership? Are characters overcoming adversity? Are there male characters experiencing complex emotions? I’m comparing these shows with most western films. That would usually tell stories through the white cisgendered straight male. I take examples from each show to how these characters are a step in the direction of proper representation. The paper addresses characters such as, Steven, Garnet, Pearl, Lapis, Rose and Greg in Steven Universe. Aang, Katara, Zuko, Iroh, Teo, Katara and Toph in Avatar: The Last Airbender. Erza, Mirajane, Gildarts and Gray from Fairy Tail.

Intercultural and International Communication in the Surrogacy Industry,"Baker, Jessica","Understanding the relationship between intercultural communication, international communication, and the proper way to discuss sensitive topics (infertility, surrogacy, LGBTQ+) in the surrogacy industry leads to strong communication. When communicating internationally or interculturally, there may be challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and cultural taboos. In order to avoid uncomfortable situations or miscommunication, knowing how to change the way we communicate with Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) is a necessity to navigate important conversations. In the surrogacy industry, knowing how to communicate interculturally and being culturally competent about sensitive topics such as infertility or loss can determine the success of a surrogacy journey and change a client's life hopefully positively. To show respect and support for others, it is important to approach these topics carefully and with knowledge. When discussing sensitive topics interculturally, the way we communicate changes from our dialog, vocabulary, tone, and approach. By consciously being aware of the changes that must be made, trust can be built when discussing sensitive topics and by showing someone your support, avoiding miscommunication, or misunderstandings due to differences in culture, sensitive topics can be better communicated interculturally.",Intercultural Communication ; Women's Studies ; LGBTQ+ ; and Transgender Studies ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Surrogacy ; Gender ; Gay ; Cultural Competence ; Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) ; Critical and Cultural Studies ; Bisexual ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; Race ; International Communication ; Lesbian ; Health Communication ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/15
"The Online Education Landscape, Digital Tools, and COVID-19","Burk, Rosetta S","The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has been the ultimate stress test for communication technologies, online learning methods, digital pedagogies, students and educators as the world faced school closures and emergency online learning situations during the pandemic lockdowns. There has been an influx in communication tools, digital paradigms, and teaching methodologies in addition to relying on existing digital tools and methods to continue students' education while unable to meet in person. The level of remote learning and digital movement is unprecedented and the results have been varied and illuminating. Research has been conducted on student attitudes in the immediate aftermath of the emergency transition, on specific teaching tools, and on remote instruction in regards to learning outcomes, but the long term effects of the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19 lockdowns on student’s educational development and prospects are still unknown. There are also the existing privacy and safety concerns for digital tool interaction that extend to education that have been exacerbated by the emergency transition. This paper will explore and evaluate the current state of online learning and the digital tools that facilitate it, as well as the recent developments in remote learning due to the emergency transition to online learning.

Amplifying Awareness Narrative Rationality in the Discourse of Childhood Cancer,"Frick, Rosalinda L","This paper looks into the complex psychological and economic effects of pediatric cancer on families. The paper has devastating realism as it draws on personal experience, as illustrated by the author's brother, Dylan, dying of brain cancer. Dylan's shortened life serves as a harsh reminder of the need to address this serious problem. The paper delves into the power of Aristotle's persuasion model, specifically looking at the concepts of ethos, pathos, and logos. This persuasion model ties into narrative rationality in the paper and looks at how a story's coherence and fidelity can make a large impact on persuasion and convincing an audience. Can storytelling make a difference in the fight against cancer? This paper aims to generate a meaningful discussion about childhood cancer by combining academic writing with personal narratives. It emphasizes the power of storytelling to shape perceptions and motivate action. This paper seeks to remember the children who have died as well as push for a change in the fight against cancer.

Gentrification Colonialism In Plain Sight?,"Henderson, Isaiah","The main focus of this research paper is to not only bring awareness to what gentrification represents but the history of it. Where it came from plus how and why it was implemented. I will dig deep on how gentrification was brought to be. Not only that but I will bring up reference points from scholars that have attended Oxford University, Harvard University, and directors of high profile economic organizations. Overall, this paper will consist of three topics intertwining colonialism and gentrification. These three topics are economic exploitation, cultural hegemony, & social disruption. As well as gentrification you do see these three involved with colonialism. At first glance gentrification is sought to be a horrible thing but a lot could be said as to how beneficial it can be. That is the sole purpose of this research I have acquired for this paper. Not only that but I’d like to bring awareness of the consequences of this choice of method that is constantly used.

Finding Joy and Community in Climate Action,"Kellom, Deanna","The goal of this paper is to discuss the ways that the conversation around climate action can be altered to center finding joy and community. Often when people hear about the state of the climate there is a sense of dread that people have reported feeling. Most people feel as though the climate has reached the point of no return and that there is nothing that any one person can do to really make a difference. This paper will talk about some ways that have worked for people in getting them to do climate action while also enjoying the work that needs to be done. Some topics that will be discussed are environmental communication as well as climate action in specific communities. There will also be an analysis on how the conversation of climate change has been handled in the past and why it makes people feel as though there is no hope. By using examples of communities that have found a way to participate in climate action, the goal will be that everyone can feel like they can take part in caring for the climate while also caring for themselves.",Communication ; Community ; Joy ; Mass Communication ; Social Influence and Political Communication ; Environmental Communication ; Climate Action,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/8
The Impact of Communication through Community and Public Radio,"Mazzucco, Matthew D","This paper intends to go into detail about the differences in communication styles found in public and community radio. Drawing on communication theories and previous empirical research, this paper will not only delve into the differences between the two categories of stations but also into the effect these types of communication styles can have on the listeners and communities targeted by these stations at large. Through a review of multiple forms of literature and academic resources, this paper will examine the roles of community and public radio as outlets for news coverage, promoting civic engagement, and as a platform for discussion about the local area around the station. This paper will additionally go into detail about the challenges these stations face due to advancements in technology, shifting preferences in programming, and a constantly changing media landscape. This paper aims to give a cohesive explanation of the differences in communication and programming in these types of stations, as well as how those styles of communication are forced to change with shifts in societal wants and needs in regard to what radio stations offer.",radio ; Communications ; dynamics ; community radio ; public radio ; journalism ; community,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/7
"Table Top Roleplaying & Communication  Rituals, Rhetoric & Reclamation","Sayles, Logan Cyrus","Broadly the topic is about the effect reclaiming a passionate will to play, act, and tell stories has on our lives and how doing so changes communication practices and the way people communicate. Narrowed further the focus is on the observable effects of Table Top Role Playing Games (linguistically narrowed down to the most popular Table Top Role Playing Game, Dungeons & Dragons) as a kind of social tool, with a further sub-focus on the stimulation and promotion of the following values and activities; acting, creative thinking, critical thinking, public speaking, self-confidence, self-empowerment, risk-taking, experimentation, active listening, teamwork/group work, storytelling, collaborative storytelling, and improv, and elaboratively how these factors are uniquely well positioned to help burgeoning employees develop workplace critical interpersonal communication soft skills. Especially in terms of providing means for those whose development was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to reclaim lost interpersonal skill development opportunities. Fair time is given to detailing the positionality of Table Top Role Playing games in relation to the broader research community and historical struggles to fully “break in”. Over the course of this research, it became increasingly clear how much of a meta-analysis of D&D’s history in Communication research specifically was necessary before even trying to answer the intended questions of employability, soft skill development, and what playing D&D could mean for the demographics of college students affected by COVID-19 in particular.",Communication ; Dungeons and Dragons ; Game-Based Learning ; Fiction ; TTRPG ; Soft Skills ; Employability ; Research Meta-Analysis,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/9
Rhetoric on Climate Change and the Effects on Public Perceptions,"Dossey, Hailey Mina Rose","One of the extraordinary challenges humans are facing today is climate change and over the past two decades, the majority of the world has moved from questioning its legitimacy to accepting it as fact. With most people having accepted climate change as a reality, the goal of climate communication has shifted from spreading awareness to motivating audiences to take action. Through this analytical discussion, we will look into effective and ineffective methods of rhetoric as it can help guide us to a better understanding of why certain rhetoric that has previously been successful in other fields may not be the best fit for this one. Given the ramifications and complexity of the climate crisis, specific and meticulous steps need to be taken to ensure a given audience receives accurate climate information while still feeling hopeful and competent in addressing the issue. Common rhetorical tactics such as fear appeals and ethos are powerful in many circumstances but leave people feeling hopeless and helpless in discussions of climate change. Through an analytical exploration of survey data, research findings, and content analysis this paper seeks to address how climate communication should be approached.",Communication ; Rhetoric ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Climate Communication ; Global Warming ; Mass Communication ; Climate ; Climate Change ; Mitigation ; Social Influence and Political Communication ; Rhetorical Appeals ; Environmental Health and Protection ; Other Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/13
A Symbolic Interactionism’s Perspective of the Attack on the U.S. Capitol.,"Hernandez, Odeli","This paper aims to draw the line between Symbolic Interactionism and how it ties into the political world. Symbolic Interactionism states that humans interpret and assign meanings to symbols through social interaction, thus influencing their behaviors and shaping their realities. It is said that symbolic interactionism could only be applied to micro levels of social interactions, and not to something as big and intricate as politics. This paper will focus on a stand-alone event, the insurrection of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Numerous symbols were displayed before, during, and after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, each of them having their own unique assigned meaning. By examining these symbols, flags, gestures, and slogans we can begin to understand and identify the meanings behind these symbols and how these meanings were assigned. Through research and analysis of these symbols and texts, we can begin to understand the messages that the rioters were trying to convey during the attack. This paper also aims to disprove that symbolic interactionism can only be applied to micro levels of communication and to showcase how it can be applied to something greater than interpersonal communication.",Donald Trump ; Communication ; insurrection ; symbolic interaction ; Social Influence and Political Communication ; politics ; Capitol,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/10

"Habitat Monitoring for Salmonid Health at Headwaters Forest Reserve in Humboldt County, California","Hutton, Allison Michelle ; Buller, Jared ; Ayala, Lauren","The influx of fine sediment causes degraded habitat for salmonid species that are under federal monitoring protocols. Within Headwaters Forest Reserve, restoration efforts for salmonids such as road decommissioning have been conducted to reduce the influx of fine sediment into streams. Post-project monitoring of salmonid habitat in impacted streams is necessary to assess restoration effectiveness. Monitoring methods include assessing pool volume, large woody debris, and sediment particle size distribution in riffles. A one-kilometer study reach was examined to give indication of this progress. Thirty-one pools were counted along this study reach. A total of 149 large woody debris pieces were found. Of that, 86 were aggregate pieces and 63 were single pieces. Pieces of wood in aggregates decreased slightly from 2005-2020. Smaller length classes of LWD weren’t observed until 2016 and longer length classes were no longer observed after 2013.  Sediment size analysis showed that 98% of particles counted in this reach were considered gravels ranging from 2-90mm. The sediment size analysis also showed that there was no significant difference in the sediment size distribution from 2005-2020, indicating that the stream should be a suitable habitat for salmonid spawning. With the exception of a few outlier years, the dimension of streambed pools has been relatively consistent over the study period.",Monitoring ; restoration ; salmonids ; Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/10
Invasive Species Removal Management Plan for the invasive species Ammophila arenaria and Carpobrotus edulis within the Samoa Dunes and Wetlands Conservation Area,"Denoncourt, Rachel J ; Jamison, Christopher A ; Skylark, Kyra D","Coastal sand dunes are invaluable ecosystems throughout the world, as they protect coastal communities (Gomez-Pina, 2002), store sand, and serve as important habitat for unique flora and fauna. Coastal sand dunes are key dynamic “natural structures which protect the coastal environment by absorbing energy from wind, tide and wave action” (AB, 1999). These ecosystems are composed of a beach berm, located closest to the water, then the incipient dune, the foredune(s), and then the backdune(s) (NSW DLWC, 2001). Dynamic systematic sand movement along and between the dune structure is key to a thriving coastal dune ecosystem (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 2020). Coastal dunes aid in preventing coastal water intrusion, flooding, and structural damage through their ability to absorb the impacts of wind and water, acting as a natural barrier against storms and high tides (Gomez-Pina, 2002). They also act as sand storage sites, supplying sand to eroded beaches through their natural movements, and provide critical habitat for a variety of plants and animals (NSW DLWC, 2001).
As humans increased their travel and migration, invasive plant species too became more widespread; two species particularly impactful to the coastal dunes in Humboldt County (California) are Ammophila arenaria and Carpobrotus edulis (Pickart, 1997). The introduction of invasive Ammophila arenaria, also known as European beachgrass, and Carpobrotus edulis, or ice plant, among other species, was a direct result of the European colonization of North America (Friends of the Dunes, 2021). Both species were planted intentionally along the west coast of North America, including Humboldt County, as a stabilizing aid. Ammophila arenaria was planted along the North Spit of Humboldt Bay to stabilize the sand along the railroad tracks (Pickart, 1997). The colonization of Turtle Island, known today as North and Central America, by both humans and plants has hugely changed and damaged the coastal dunes along the west coast of the United States. From the southernmost coastal dunes of California to the northern dunes in Washington, Ammophila arenaria restricts natural dune movements and threatens the native coastal dune mat vegetation (Pickart, 1997). While various other invasive species negatively impact coastal dune ecosystems, the colonizing and stabilizing nature of Ammophila arenaria and Carpobrotus edulis make their management and removal critical to restoring and rehabilitating invaded coastal dunes such as the Samoa Dunes and Wetlands Conservation Area.
The Samoa Dunes and Wetlands Conservation Area is a 357-acre property that lies within the unceded current and ancestral homeland of the Indigenous Wiyot people (Figure 1) (Friends of the Dunes, 2021). The site is called Twaya’t in the native language of the Wiyot people, often referred to in English as the North Spit; and lies between Wigi: the Humboldt Bay and shou’r: the Pacific Ocean (Butler, 2012). Along the Samoa Peninsula, the Samoa Dunes and Wetlands Conservation Area property is directly west of the Samoa Bridge and immediately south of the Manila Dunes Recreation Area (Friends of the Dunes, 2021). The site may be familiar to some local community members as it is on the path of the Kinetic Grand Championship race, and the area includes what was formerly known as Dead Man’s Drop Forest and Dog Ranch within its boundaries (Evans, 2021). The property consists of an abandoned home structure, various other outbuildings, a ranch facility, multiple stretches of coastal dune habitats and a rare old-growth coastal dune forest (Greenson, 2020). The acquisition of this property by Friends of the Dunes creates a continuous stretch of over 1,600 acres of native coastal dune habitat, dedicated and protected exclusively for conservation efforts and recreational usage (Kemp, 2020).",Beachgrass ; Environmental Sciences ; Dunes ; Iceplant ; Restoration ; Friends of the dunes ; Humboldt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/15

Wood Creek Tidal Marsh Enhancement Project  Benthic Macroinvertebrate Monitoring Report 2019,"Morrison, Alex T ; Hagerty, Jett W ; Branson, Claire M","The focus of this report was to monitor benthic macroinvertebrate communities on the Freshwater Farms Reserve, which underwent two phases of restoration as part of the Wood Creek Tidal Marsh Enhancement Project in 2009-2010 and 2016-2018. Objectives for the restoration activities were to increase winter rearing refugia habitat for several threatened/endangered fish species such as the tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The goals of this project were to (1) sample and identify BMIs along a salinity gradient in Wood Creek; (2) assess water quality; and (3) report general trajectory of community composition over time. Results show that the abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates increased dramatically in Wood Creek in 2019 for all sampled sites when compared to previous years of monitoring data. Three taxa accounted for over 99% of the overall composition at each of the sample sites. Increased abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates may provide additional nutritional support for fish present in Wood Creek and Freshwater Creek. Overall, Freshwater Farms Reserve’s post-restoration ecological trajectory seems to be improving in relation to the goals of supporting fish refugia for threatened/endangered species.",Brackish ; Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/5
"Drought Effects on Germination Rate of Two Sagebrush Species, Artemisia cana and Artemisia arbusula, and Comparison of Seed Counts using a Photography App and Weighing","Kelly, Sam S ; McKinney, Cessair E","Sagebrush steppe ecosystems have been impacted by climate change, grazing, and invasive plants. While some widespread sagebrush species have been well-studied, including big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), others like silver sagebrush (Artemisia cana) and low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula) are understudied. To learn more about how to restore these important ecosystems, we conducted a germination study of two sagebrush species. We germinated seeds from A. cana in petri plates and in soil to compare the rates of germination in both methods, while A. arbuscula seeds were germinated only in petri plates. We also tested the efficiency of weighing and a photography app to estimate the number of seeds. The germination rate for both species was low, but there was a strong correlation between the manual seed counts and the app counts as well as the seed counts and seed weights. It is possible that A. cana and A. arbuscula naturally have low germination rates or the lack of pre-trial treatment of seeds could have contributed to the low germination rates. Though our results were limited, there is a possibility that drought could have an effect on seed germination, and subsequently the success of future restoration projects, but that more research is needed.",Environmental Sciences ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; photography app ; drought ; Plant Sciences ; sagebrush ; seed germination,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/11

Management Recommendations for Jacoby Creek Land Trust’s Off-Channel Pond Site at the Kotke Ranch and Nature Preserve,"Sosa Morales, Marcos Adrian ; Flynn, Maeve ; Tague, Auston","Now more than ever there is a need for conservation easements within California because of ongoing degradation, urbanization, clear cutting and loss of habitat to ecosystems due to wildfires. The Jacoby Creek Land Trust (JCLT) is in need of a restoration and conservation plan regarding constructed off-channel ponds along Jacoby Creek. One of the ponds is flourishing and supporting different types of fishes during their migration. The other pond, our project location, is struggling to meet the JCLT’s project objectives. The pond is overgrown with European grasses due to the surrounding grazing land and has yet to see the pond's potential. There has been little to no maintenance in regards to this area, thus there is work to be done.
The JCLT recently received a five-year grant to restore the off-channel pond and the adjacent riparian habitat. Within this report, we focus solely on the off-channel location. We recommend ways to address various problems in the site by providing the Land Trust with a management plan to help them meet their goals for the off-channel pond to serve a multitude of functions. These recommendations include brief flash grazing of the site, accessibility to the public for recreational use, habitat enhancement, and addition of pollinator-friendly vegetation.",Biological inventory ; Applied restoration ; Environmental Health ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Restoration ; Trail and interpretation plan ; Applied ecological restoration ; Native vegetation ; Jacoby Creek ; Recommendations ; Off-channel pond,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/13
Determining the influence of Lupinus Arboreus and the recruitment of non native species in the Lanphere Dunes,"Domingo, Cleo Mae B ; Hakala, Jennifer K ; Layfield, Dylan C","The sand dunes of the Pacific Northwest are dynamic and house diverse dune mat communities. Introduction of non native species into dune mat communities change soil characteristics of dunes, such as the case of yellow bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus). Lupine establishment provides ideal conditions for other non natives to invade. These impacts have been observed within the Lanphere Dunes Unit of the Humboldt Bay Wildlife Refuge in Arcata, California. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) plans to test lupine eradication methods in a one acre parcel within Lanphere. This study aims to collect baseline data for that parcel, focusing on the effects of lupine on native dune mat. We determined the number of lupine individuals within the site, the species composition compared to two reference sites, and soil organic matter content within the project area. The large amount of lupine was correlated with the high cover of annual grasses. In contrast, the uninvaded area had the highest cover of dune mat and open sand, representing a healthy dune ecosystem. Soil samples showed that the non native species contributed to the increased organic matter content within the soil. This study provides insight into the impacts of lupine on a dune community.",Baseline data ; Humboldt County ; Yellow bush lupine ; Coastal dunes ; US Fish and Wildlife Service ; Soil composition ; Environmental Sciences ; Non native species ; Lupine eradication ; Annual grasses ; Ecological restoration ; Dune mat ; Dune habitats,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/16
"Belowground plant communities seed bank dynamics and relationship to aboveground vegetation in grazing allotment of Klamath County, Oregon","Morse, Dellaina C ; Estepa, Scott M","Seed banks are valuable resources for restoration but are understudied. The species present in the aboveground composition influence the seed bank through seed inputs. Land managers utilize herbicides to selectively reduce certain species in the above- and belowground composition. The aim of this paper is to observe and assess the species present in a seed bank post-herbicide application, and to discuss the seed bank potential for future restoration at the specific site in Klamath County, Oregon. Soil core samples were collected in the field and brought to the lab where they were processed and prepared for germination. We watered and monitored propagation trays in a greenhouse for emerging species that were then pulled, transplanted, and identified. We found that a total of 284 seeds germinated, representing 20 species. In contrast, there were 8 species present in the aboveground plant community. Belowground seed bank composition and aboveground species composition were on average 84% dissimilar. Lastly, we found a negative relationship between seed density and litter depth. Management actions, such as herbicide application and targeted grazing, have the potential to reduce exotic aboveground species, and allow for native species in the seed bank to passively join the aboveground composition. This study highlights the need for future management of aboveground undesired species to allow competitive release of seed bank species to emerge.",Agricultural Science ; Environmental Sciences ; Invasive ; Seed bank ; Bonanza ; Rangeland degradation ; Taeniatherum caput-medusae ; Other Plant Sciences ; Other Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Weed Science ; Land management ; Herbicide,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/18
Measuring new growth of kinnikinnick and brown elfin butterfly abundance at the Ma-le’l & Lanphere Dunes implications for the management of the seaside hoary elfin butterfly,"Murphy, Aidan Jack ; Sanchez, Verenice Elizabeth ; Rahimi, Leila M ; Villasenor, Magdalena A","The study assessed changes in inflorescence length of kinnikinnick (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) new growth and the abundance of brown elfin butterflies (Callophrys augustinas) at the Ma-le’l and Lanphere Dunes. The research took place at the Ma-le’l and Lanphere Dunes in Humboldt County where a surrogate species for the seaside hoary elfin–the brown elfin–is abundant. In the larval stage, the brown elfin feeds on the new growth of kinnikinnick. Our study set out to analyze the food resource availability for brown elfin butterfly larvae, as they are forage on the tender leaves associated with the new growth of kinnikinnick inflorescences. We found a higher abundance of brown elfins was slightly correlated with areas where the average kinnikinnick inflorescence growth rate was higher. Our analysis of several environmental factors in each plot (ant presence, canopy cover, and herbivory) concluded that the variables tested had no significant relationship with the growth of kinnikinnick inflorescences. Future studies should use a longer study interval than the two-week interval used in this study; a longer interval would make it easier to capture changes in the inflorescence length of kinnikinnick.

Management Recommendations for Ecological Restoration on the Little River Parcel,"Partain, Maya Sady ; Mathews, Garitt","Ecological restoration is an important aspect of land management. Data collection and ongoing monitoring help inform restoration decisions and determine their effectiveness. In this project, we followed a monitoring protocol provided by the Trinidad Coastal Land Trust to assess the 2019 status of their Little River parcel, a fifteen-acre area near the mouth of Little River in Trinidad, California. We performed a site analysis of invasive plant species and recorded their extent and location, as well as noting other observations of the ecology, topography, and biology of the site. After making our observations, we recommended land management methods woven together with ecological restoration techniques to help bring the ecosystem of Little River back to its full potential.",Humboldt County ; Trinidad ; Environmental Sciences ; Invasive Species ; Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology ; Invasive Plant Management ; Ammophila arenaria ; Ecology ; Hedera helix ; Little River ; Biodiversity ; Restoration ; California ; Trinidad Coastal Land Trust,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/3

Comparison of Benthic Macroinvertebrate Composition and Concentration in Marginally- Versus Perennially-Inundated Sites on the Trinity River,"Libunao, Tate E ; Cervi, Chris ; Trent, Colton ; Mounivong, Lesli","Flow regulation has significant impacts on river ecosystems including aquatic vegetation, benthic macroinvertebrates, and salmonids (Caldwell et al., 2018). The Trinity River is an example of a flow-regulated river that has experienced a decline in fish populations and ecological health (Beechie et al., 2015). This study uses benthic macroinvertebrates (BMIs) as indicators of fish habitat quality. We compare the abundance and composition of BMI communities before and after a rain event that inundated marginal habitat. Samples were collected at marginally- and perennially-inundated sites on the Trinity River in Junction City, California in January and February 2020. The resulting data illuminated that there was not a significant (p-value=0.27) increase in BMI abundance or diversity in marginal habitats post-inundation. This non-significant result may be attributed to the small sample size and high variability in the data. As we learn more about how flow regimes affect BMI abundance and diversity within marginal habitats, dam managers can be more informed on managing flow regimes to promote more healthy fisheries.",Trinity River ; Benthic ; Environmental Sciences ; Hess ; Marginal Inundation ; Invertebrates ; Perennial,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/8
"Prevalence of Hesperevax sparsiflora var. brevifolia (short-leaved evax) at Ocean Ranch, Humboldt County, California exploring the effects of disturbance","DiQuirco, Shelby ; Estrada, Matthew ; Fraley, Alana T ; Smith, Alexander D","The prevalence of special-status plants within a landscape can be an indicator of the ecological health of that site, and therefore inform restoration efforts and post-restoration monitoring. Hesperevax sparsiflora var. brevifolia (short-leaved evax) is a special status species found within the Ocean Ranch unit of Humboldt, California. A primary threat to native plant communities are invasive plant species. Coastal dune ecosystems are largely dominated by invasive species, including Ammophila arenaria (European beachgrass). To work towards the eradication of A. arenaria, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife utilized treatment combinations of herbicide and prescribed fire at Ocean Ranch in the fall of 2022. We worked with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to study the density and abundance of H. sparsiflora var. brevifolia, proximity to A. arenaria, soil compaction, and distance to the road within specified areas. We estimated a total of 14,354,293 H. sparsiflora var. brevifolia individuals in the polygons we measured. We found that the further from A. arenaria, the greater the likelihood of H. sparsiflora var. brevifolia individuals. However, our findings showed that the number of individuals and distance to the road was not a significant relationship, and the relationship between the number of individuals in burned versus unburned quadrats was not significant. This project can serve to monitor the establishment of special-status species to observe the success of recent restorative treatments and to guide future restoration.",Environmental Monitoring ; Population Biology ; Environmental Sciences ; Prescribed burn ; Invasive monitoring ; Prescribed fire ; Botany ; Environmental Indicators and Impact Assessment ; Invasive management ; Ammophila arenaria ; Species monitoring ; Hesperevax sparsiflora var. brevifolia ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Dune mat community ; Short-leaved evax ; Population density,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/19
"Evaluating benthic macroinvertebrate populations in response to scouring events in the Trinity River, CA","Hay, Liam ; O'Neil, Michael W ; Pieper-Wasem, Chloe","River systems across California have been impacted by appurtenant structures such as dams and diversions. These structures have had an adverse impact on Benthic invertebrate (BMI) communities by regulating river systems and changing the natural hydraulic pulses that follow seasonal precipitation. Benthic invertebrates are a critical food resource for salmonids and serve as an indicator of ecosystem health. Our study was interested in seeing the effects of scouring events on BMI in the Trinity River of Trinity County, C.A. Following a large precipitation event that occurred in the region in December 2022, an influx of water entered the river through flood releases from Lewiston Dam, natural storm runoff, and accretion from regional tributaries along the Trinity River. The BMI samples from the Pear Tree Gulch site were used to measure the effects of the scouring event that occurred between January 8 and January 14, 2023. Our results showed that the Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) increased after the scouring event, the composition changed, and overall abundance decreased after the scour event. This study suggests that an isolated period of scouring in a regulated system does not result in BMI metrics associated with unregulated systems that experience frequent scouring events.",Natural Resources Management and Policy ; Trinity River ; Entomology ; Benthic ; Aquaculture and Fisheries ; Environmental Monitoring ; Environmental Sciences ; Geomorphology ; Water Resource Management ; Scour ; Dams ; Salmonids ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Trinity ; Salmon ; Hydrology ; Invertebrates ; Other Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/21
Determining Spatial Distribution and Habitat Use for Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in Hoopa Tribal Streams Using Occupancy Modeling to Inform Restoration,"Boone, Ely D ; Frazer-Newcomb, Seamus C ; Taylor, Brit A","Pacific salmonid populations have faced significant decline due to poor management and human disturbance. Habitat restoration and monitoring is essential to the ongoing survival of these fish. This study examines population abundance of juvenile Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and steelhead trout (O. mykiss) in five tributaries of the Trinity River in Northern California to determine the success of recent restoration efforts. We used traditional snorkel survey methods paired with an occupancy model to compare populations of two restored streams and four unrestored streams. We found that despite Coho being detected in all six streams, restored sites were less likely to have Coho compared to the unrestored streams. When Coho are not detected there was a high probability that the undetected fish was in fact not present in the site. We attribute these findings to the complexity of the restored streams making detection less likely, lack of riparian cover, and a low surveyor detection probability. Despite these contrarian findings, it is likely that as riparian vegetation matures and increases cover and shading, salmonids will use these streams in greater numbers. Our findings will aid in informing managers of how restoration decisions will affect Coho salmon populations.",Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/1

The damage to human lives and property caused by wildfires has prompted all levels of government to galvanize planning efforts to better respond to and recover from wildfire.  This report summarizes the need for effective wildfire recovery planning for the City of Arcata, California.  The city is currently working on its Hazard Mitigation Plan to be eligible for funding under FEMA hazard mitigation grant programs.  This report seeks to inform the city by highlighting the importance of incorporating recovery planning into the Hazard Mitigation Plan.  Research was conducted via review of other plans and interviews of officials and those affected by wildfires.  The gathered information was used to identify current short and long-term resources that exist for the recovery of residents, businesses, and schools.  Through this process gaps in current wildfire recovery resources were identified and this information was used to make recommendations to the City of Arcata for their Hazard Mitigation Plan.

It is critical to preserve these species because it facilitates growth of native plants. Ecological restoration provides the necessary conditions to encourage native plant growth. Gilia millefoliata, Erysimum menziesii, and Layia carnosa are three rare plants found on the Friends of the Dunes property in Arcata, CA. In this assessment, we surveyed these three rare plants and came up with a management plan for the Barr Parcel on the Friends of the Dunes property. Friends of the Dunes recently acquired the Barr Parcel and are waiting for restoration permits for this site. The objectives of this project were to locate and plot locations of three rare plant species, create three informative maps that display the extent of the current habitat for these three rare species, and prescribe a feasible management plan for each of the three rare species that encourages successful propagation and re-colonization throughout their natural habitat.

"Assessment of Tree Attributes and Understory Vegetation Composition Six Years Post-thinning in Redwood National Park (Northern CA, USA)","Andrews, Valerie ; Vongsa, Michelle ; Giraldo, Stacy","Coastal redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) are a resilient tree species that once dominated coastal ecosystems. However, redwood forests have experienced numerous impacts compromising their health and vigor, which has led to greater competition from other tree species. Foresters and Ecologists are utilizing novel restoration strategies to conserve and recover redwood forests. This project’s objective was to assess tree attributes and understory composition six years after a restoration thinning treatment. The study took place in Redwood National Park in Orick, California along Holter Ridge Road at a site named Middle Fork Lost Man Creek. In 2015, a student capstone group from Humboldt State University collected data for three plots before and immediately after a thinning treatment. Six years later (2021), our capstone group resampled the data in these plots and added tree height and understory vegetation parameters. Results found that total basal area/acre increased from 205.4 in 2015 (post-thinning) to 215.0 in 2021 and the quadratic mean diameter increased from 17.5 inches in 2015 (post-thinning) to 18.9 inches in 2021.

"Effects of Beaver Dam Analogs on stream channel complexity and overbank flow recurrence on McGarvey Creek (Del Norte County, CA)","Anderson, Johanna ; Khechfe, Andreas","The North American Beaver (Castor canadensis) used to span nearly the entirety of North America but was nearly extirpated from many river systems due to human encroachment and exploitation. With the removal of these ecosystem engineers, streams and rivers lost a level of complexity that was previously provided by the presence of beaver dams. One river that has been affected is the Klamath River, which flows through 257 miles of southern Oregon and northern California and is essential to many communities, including the Yurok Tribe (USFWS, 2013). The Yurok Tribal Fisheries Program (YTFP) began installing Beaver Dam Analogs (BDAs) in McGarvey Creek in 2018 as a way of mitigating stream damage caused by historic land use and the decline in Castor canadensis populations. Objectives included increasing stream habitat complexity for native salmonids, including threatened Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). BDAs influence stream geomorphology, and monitoring the characteristics of these influences will further help us understand their potential role in restoration. Our study compared stream channel morphology of nine cross-sections at three BDAs at McGarvey Creek BDA Site 1 between two time periods: immediately following installation of the BDAs (2018), and three years post-BDA installation (2021). An overbank flow analysis was also conducted to observe changes in floodplain connectivity through the comparison of shear stress, wetted perimeter, and velocity values pre-BDA construction (2017), immediately following BDA installation (2018), and post-BDA installation (2021). The BDAs at our study site increased floodplain connectivity to adjacent hydrologic units and the addition of BDAs added a level of stream complexity previously lost. This study has provided further understanding of how BDAs influence stream geomorphology and fisheries habitat over time in McGarvey Creek.",Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_esm/17
Jacoby Creek Site Inventory Assessment and Management Recommendations for Parcel 502-052-022,"Dent, Sean M ; Tavakoli Ardakani, Aida ; Arnold, Mia C.","Jacoby Creek is a 16.6 mi2 watershed that discharges into Humboldt Bay in Humboldt County, California. Legacy use of this watershed consisted of unmanaged logging and diking to create pastureland for agriculture until the 1970’s. Currently, 187 acres of the Jacoby Creek watershed is owned by the Jacoby Creek Land Trust (JCLT). JCLT focuses on creating a space for recreation and conservation within the Jacoby Creek watershed.
The parcel (parcel 502-052-022) was assessed to identify social trails, invasive species, tree density, and upland understory vegetation to provide restoration recommendations. Non-native invasive species, such as Hedera helix (English ivy) and Rubus armeniacus (Himalayan Blackberry), without proper management have the potential to grow and outcompete native flora. A system of social trails were found, most of which lead to less accessible routes. It is recommended that JCLT discourage the use of social trails by covering trail entrances and with online notices and other forms of outreach. A tree density assessment was conducted on the previously logged, second growth forest, showing it is of high density.

CalTrout partnered with the landowner, McKinleyville Community Services District, to restore 4.25 acres of the estuary. Our project focused on reducing the abundance of invasive plant species within the estuary area. The target plant species were barnyard grass, Canada thistle, and cocklebur. First, we conducted a literature review to learn the best management practices for eradicating the three target species. Then we conducted a field survey to locate all individuals of each plant on the project site. At each location, we recorded the proximity to water, the extent of each patch of barnyard grass and Canada thistle (not cocklebur because they occurred only as single plants), and described the soil and terrain. Next, we developed a treatment plan for the eradication of barnyard grass, Canada thistle, and cocklebur based on the data we gathered through our research and field survey, as well as stipulations set by the landowner. We suggested hand removal and an annual return to retreat before each species flowers. Hand removal methods were outlined as a step-by-step process for future volunteers assisting CalTrout. Lastly, we conducted a volunteer event to evaluate our removal methods for Canada thistle.",Environmental Monitoring ; Sustainability ; Steelhead ; Invasive plants ; Environmental Sciences ; Coho ; Barnyard grass ; Mad River ; Canada thistle ; Baduwa't ; Salmonids ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Plant Sciences ; Chinook ; Cocklebur,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/1

"Cultural and Ecological Restoration of School Creek at Blue Lake Rancheria, Humboldt County, CA","French, Cecilia C ; Mendoza, Michelle ; Galindo, Roots ; O'Neil, August","The School Creek Cultural Revegetation and Riparian Restoration Project site is a low elevation riparian forest surrounding the seasonal creek channel approximately a mile from its confluence with the Baduwa’t (Mad River). The site was originally restored in 2021, with recontouring of the channel and revegetation, however mortality occurred for many planted species which prompted this 2023 project. The School Creek site has been severely degraded over the last hundred years from land use practices, industrialization, and colonization. Streams that have been damaged by heavy logging have created high sedimentation levels within the Baduwa’t, which is listed as “impaired” on the U.S Environmental Protection Agency’s 303(d) list for excessive siltation/sedimentation and temperature (State of CA North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, 2018). Additionally, the industrialization of the town of Blue Lake has altered the natural course of the School Creek channel and landscape by building a school, railroad grade, mill, and housing. The forcible separation of the Wiyot people from their ancestral land halted native management practices, further pushing the degradation of the watershed. The lower Baduwa’t riparian area was converted to pasture for grazing sheep and cows. However, since 1983, Blue Lake Rancheria has worked to buy land back in the watershed and restore it (Wiyot Tribe, 2023). This project is on Blue Lake Rancheria land, and seeks to restore the riparian area by utilizing native and culturally significant plants which have been cultivated for specific purposes since time immemorial by the Wiyot people.

"Analysis of Benthic Macroinvertebrate Response to Restoration Flows and Scour in the Trinity River, Northern California","Gutierrez, Sarah ; Avina, Julie","This study investigates the ecological impact of restoration flows and scouring events on benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) communities within the Trinity River, an ecosystem historically impacted by anthropogenic activities. Central to this study is the examination of how hydrologic alterations, especially the construction of the Lewiston Dam, have influenced these vital ecological indicators. Using data collected earlier in 2023 from a current study by Benjamin King, we analyzed BMI samples from three river sites (Junction City, Pear Tree, and Lorenz Gulch), both prior to and following a major scouring event in January 2023. This paper utilizes statistical analyses, including ANOVA and t-tests, to assess changes in BMI biomass and species diversity. Notably, the results demonstrate a significant reduction in BMI biomass post-scour, with a significant shift in the community composition towards species more beneficial as salmonid prey. These findings highlight the ecological shifts occurring in response to managed river restoration efforts and stress the importance of considering BMI dynamics in river restoration management. This study contributes valuable insights into riverine ecosystem responses to environmental management strategies, offering an understanding of the impacts on aquatic biodiversity.",Natural Resources Management and Policy ; Environmental Monitoring ; River ; Water Resource Management ; Water ; Scour ; Macroinvertebrates ; Scouring ; Environmental Indicators and Impact Assessment ; Invertebrates ; Restoration,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/4
"Sampling Lepidopter Moth Diversity across Different Treatment Plots at the Ocean Ranch Unit in the Eel River Wildlife Area, Humboldt County, California","Kragness, Cory M ; Montiel, Madison S ; Budke, Victoria C ; Chapman, Ryanne N","Coastal dune ecosystems in the Pacific Northwest are known to be highly complex, dynamic, and are relatively vulnerable to climatic changes (Madurapperuma, B, et al. 2020). There are many evolving factors that have the potential to influence the coastal dune ecosystem ecology. For example, disturbance from noxious non-native species, anthropogenic factors, fire, and climatic changes are known to affect the stability of active coastal dune systems (DaSilva, M et al. 2021). The widespread colonization of European beachgrass (Ammophila arenaria) is a specific disrupter of coastal dune ecology as introduced non-native species and has decreased biodiversity of flora and fauna at the Ocean Ranch Unit in the Eel River Wildlife Area (Ocean Ranch Restoration Project Final EIR, 2021). An estimated 40 to 60 percent of the coastal dune system has been covered by Ammophila arenaria since its introduction to Humboldt County in the 1970’s (Ocean Ranch Restoration Project Final EIR, 2021). In restoration of the coastal dune system, the Ocean Ranch Restoration Project has employed a variety of eradication strategies including prescribed burning, herbicide application, manual removal, mechanical removal, or a combination of methods (Ocean Ranch Restoration Project Final EIR, 2021). However, evaluating the recolonization of biological communities is important in monitoring the success of these treatments. Lepidoptera are newly emerging as an effective indicator species of ecosystem health due to their population relationship to successional stages of ecosystem development (Dar, A. A. & Jamal, K. 2021). In support of monitoring the reestablishing coastal dune communities, this study examines the Lepidopteran abundance and diversity through sampling of moth assemblages in the treatment plots of the Ocean Ranch Restoration Project (ORRP).",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/5

"Mapping Kinnikinnick and Assessing Habitat Factors for Brown Elfin Butterfly at the North Ma-le’l Dunes, California","Lacey, Harper ; McGuire, Elizabeth ; Tubridy, Sienna ; McKenna, Mark","Climate change, caused by anthropogenic influence, has resulted in rising temperatures across the globe. This has contributed to sea level rise which has negatively impacted coastal endangered species. Rising temperatures threaten habitat conditions through fragmentation and encroachment of invasive species. Habitat fragmentation and the spread of invasive species have already been worsened by European colonialistic ideas of exploiting the environment for its natural resources, which makes sea level rise an additional issue. California has been affected by sea level rise in various ways and dune ecosystems are experiencing many of those impacts. In Humboldt County, our project site borders the Pacific Ocean at the North Spit of the Ma-le’l dunes with few endangered species present. The brown elfin butterfly (Callophrys augustinus) serves an important role in the dunes. The butterflies and their host plant, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (kinnikinnick or bearberry) are abundant, so data collection and analysis can help determine management practices for the endangered, Incisalia polia maritima (Seaside hoary elfin) butterfly in Oregon. By assessing the habitat of the brown elfin butterfly, our team measured the patch size of its host plant kinnikinnick by using a handheld GPS receiver and a thirty-meter tape. We observed butterfly and ant-hill sightings to expand on our findings, as well. We recorded seventy-two kinnikinnick patches and calculated a median of 25 meters and a standard deviation of 193.7 meters. Two groups of kinnikinnick patches with pseudoabsence data generated in ArcGIS Pro were created, but no conclusions were drawn.

Influence of Elevation on Plant Survivorship in Baduwa’t Estuary,"Toledo, Richard Louis, Jr. ; Aguilera, Celine ; Prater, Rivé ; Durbin, Claire","The Baduwa’t is a river in Humboldt County, California that has been adversely impacted by agricultural operations. Disturbances from agriculture have altered the surrounding ecosystems and hydrology of the river. The conservation stewardship group, California Trout, initiated a collaborative restoration project that created a new channel and off-channel pond to provide habitat for salmonids and other native fish in the estuary. As an extension of this project, sections of the site underwent revegetation efforts. The survivorship rates of this new vegetation were lower than anticipated and we were asked by California Trout to assess if the elevation on the site could be influencing plant success rates. To determine if proximity to groundwater through elevation was the cause, we assessed plant statuses and compared them to an elevation map utilizing ArcGIS Pro. After comparing the results, we did not find any clear correlation between elevation and plant success. We then compiled a list of potential recommendations such as mulching, the use of mycorrhizae, the influence of canopy cover, shelterwood, and various planting methods.",Pond ; Environmental Monitoring ; Groundwater ; Other Environmental Sciences ; Riparian Corridor ; Plant Survivorship ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Environmental Health and Protection ; Restoration ; Vegetation ; Root Proximity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/18
"Riparian Revegetation Re-Indigenizing the Powers Creek Tributary of the Baduwa’t Watershed at Blue Lake Rancheria, California","Beltran, Genesis ; Lopez, Ruben ; Stock, Ben","This project focuses on the ecological and cultural restoration of Powers Creek, a tributary of the Baduwa’t watershed at Blue Lake Rancheria, California. Riparian ecosystems play a critical role in biodiversity, water quality, and climate resilience, particularly for species like salmonids reliant on cold-water refugia. The restoration efforts, guided by Indigenous knowledge, addressed the removal of non-native competitive species such as Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and French broom (Genista monspessulana) – which are shown to increase wildfire severity and challenge native plant communities – in addition to freeing established plantings of vegetative competition. Through collaborative planning with the Rancheria, this study employed mechanical removal methods and geospatial mapping to assess site conditions and plant survivability. Results indicated higher mortality rates for plantings situated in rockier substrates and highlighted the resilience of certain culturally significant species over others. Recommendations include continuous prolific species management, future bank stabilization efforts for the growing cut bank on site, the inclusion of cultural burning practices to suppress seed banks, and targeted replanting efforts to aid the shift in dominance back to native species. This integrated approach centers Indigenous knowledge and fosters long-term ecological and cultural sustainability through Indigenous stewardship frameworks.",Natural Resources Management and Policy ; Environmental Monitoring ; Sustainability ; Riparian ecology ; Ecological monitoring ; Water Resource Management ; French broom ; Indigenous management ; Ecological restoration ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Scotch broom ; Invasive plant removal ; Ecocultural restoration ; Traditional ecological knowledge ; Other Environmental Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/25
Baduwa’t Estuary Riparian Restoration & Revegetation Plan,"Patino, Brandon ; Kennedy, Blake ; Rodriguez, Xitlalli","The Baduwa’t estuary Restoration Project in McKinleyville, California is a place of interest to community members for a variety of reasons – ecological, recreational, and tribal among some of them. The estuary connects the Mad River Watershed to the Pacific Ocean. The project opened four acres of habitat to juvenile salmon and steelhead populations that utilize the watershed while migrating to the ocean. Complications regarding the size and success of plant species and riparian zone expansion remained. Using a list of 9 targeted native plants, we created a botanical literature review focusing on native plants to guide future efforts to revegetate and restore natural functions. We collected information on native trees, grasses, and herbs. Information included propagation methods as well as indigenous and ethnobotanical functions for each species.

"Assessing understory vegetation response and fuel load levels following silvicultural treatments in Headwaters Forest Reserve, Humboldt County, California","Railton, Kyle James ; Tatar, Madison","Old growth forests are important for ecological resilience, especially in temperate rainforest ecosystems. There are presently 3,000 acres of old growth forest within the 7,472 acres of the Headwaters Forest Reserve (HFR) in Humboldt County, California. Remaining acres were subjected to unsustainable logging practices, such as clearcutting, that resulted in a severely overstocked second-growth forest. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) created a management plan for the reserve to restore previously harvested areas to their historic condition. The goal for the BLM is to accelerate growth rates of residual forests, to align them on a trajectory of achieving old-growth forest conditions. Silviculture treatments can be used to achieve this objective. This study examined the effects of “Accelerated Recruitment” and “Thinned” treatments on understory vegetation and fuel loading levels along the Elk River Trail in the Headwaters Forest Reserve, by comparing percent cover of understory vegetation and fuel loading in plots receiving different treatment types. The results from the study revealed that the “Accelerated Recruitment” treatment had both the highest species diversity of understory plants and the highest amount of fuel load (tons/acre) in the understory, on average. These preliminary results show that treatment types should be tailored depending on the needs of the project.",Fuel loading ; Silviculture ; Forest Management ; Brown's transects ; Thinning ; Forest Biology ; Redwood restoration ; Understory vegetation,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/27

Many of these species are federally recognized as threatened due to habitat loss and degradation. Large woody debris in streams and rivers creates suitable refugia and spawning habitat for salmonid species. Between 2021-2023 the Bureau of Land Management placed approximately 200 pieces of wood into the South Fork Elk River, as part of their accelerated recruitment program in an effort to reintroduce habitat complexity. A survey was conducted on a stretch of the Elk River to gather information on the size, type, composition, and decay class of single pieces of wood as well as wood jams. This data was subjected to analysis and will be used for future recommendations and studies involving the addition of large woody debris for salmonid habitat.

Implications of using eDNA as a monitoring tool in the Elk River estuary,"Spencer, Trinity Brooke ; Wheatley, Christy Elaine ; Martinez, Fernando Edgar","This study compares the efficacy of environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling to traditional capture-based methods such as seine netting and minnow trapping for monitoring fish assemblages in the Elk River estuary. The Elk River estuary is located in Humboldt County, California and hosts a diverse range of fish species due to its tidal influences and brackish habitat. A restoration is planned for this area, thus it is important to explore the effectiveness of different fish monitoring methods that could be used to evaluate restoration success. For this capstone project, we conducted a pilot study at five sites within the Elk River estuary, where water samples for eDNA analysis of fish species were collected alongside capture-based fish sampling methods (seining and minnow trapping) for comparison. These five sites are potentially inhabited by several species of interest including: coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii), tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), and longfin smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys). We then generated a monitoring plan based on our findings from the pilot study with sites for immediate sampling and sites where sampling should be conducted once the restoration project is completed. Included in the monitoring plan are limitations to eDNA sampling with reflections on the strengths of both eDNA and capture-based samplings. Overall, we found that eDNA sampling was less labor intensive and easier to conduct compared to seining and minnow trapping. The results from this pilot study and subsequent monitoring plan are intended to help organizations such as CalTrout to determine the most effective and cost-efficient methods to monitor fish species as part of restoration post-project assessment.",estuary ; tidewater goby ; longfin smelt ; Environmental Sciences ; salmonids ; fisheries management ; fisheries ; eDNA sampling ; monitoring ; restoration,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/22
"Examining Coastal redwood forest  understory vegetation as socio-ecological indicators of health and resilience in Headwaters Forest Reserve, California","Lopez, Rhiannon","Coastal redwood old-growth forests are widely considered as some of the most ecologically significant landscapes, rich in both cultural and environmental history. These forests have provided essential habitat for threatened species and support a complex web of life for flora, fauna, and Indigenous people since time immemorial. However, the forced removal of Indigenous peoples, loss of Indigenous stewardship and the prioritization of Western management objectives–such as intensive logging– have resulted in habitat degradation and fragmentation, severely disrupting ecological cycles. Approximately 95% of Coastal redwood old-growth forests have been lost to extractive industries, with the remaining 5% mostly held in conservation within government controlled reserves. The Headwaters Forest Reserve (HFR), established in 1999,  is located in Humboldt County, California and holds a protected 7,472-acre area, with 3,000 acres being old-growth forest and the remaining acreage characterized as secondary and third growth forests.
Over 150 years of shifting management practices in the reserve are still evident on the landscape as overcrowded forest stands with dense canopies, forming inhospitable conditions that have diminished biodiversity and reduced understory richness. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is seeking to treat overcrowded stands through active silvicultural management of residual forests and utilize the Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) to invite Indigenous stewardship back into the reserve. This study examines the need to modify existing Western scientific approaches to forest and understory management, advocating for a more holistic approach for best management practices for the development of effective restoration goals.",Environmental Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/29
Determining the Quality and Quantity of California Sitka Spruce (Picea Sitchensis) on Private Commercial Timberland for Use in Domestic Acoustic Steel-String Guitars,"Cooper, Ryan Eugene","Development of additional revenue streams for timber products with relatively low profitability is an important step in securing future economic success for the forestry sector in Humboldt county. Utilization of California Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) for use in domestic acoustic steel-string guitar manufacturing may provide exactly that. Determining the quality and quantity of California Sitka spruce is the logical first step in achieving this.
Quality was determined from tree core samples gathered at sites on Green Diamond Resource Company’s (GDRco) California timberlands and the Arcata Community Forest (ACF) with high basal area of Sitka spruce. Rings Per Inch (RPI) is the most significant indicator in quality for guitar manufacturing (Pedgley et al., 2009) and was used as the anchor for tree core analysis. Cores were analyzed for the mean annual RPI of the stem and other physiological measurements. A minimum mean RPI of 10 was used to determine acceptability for manufacturing use (Stephens, 2015). Statistical tests determined significant differences in mean RPIs between GDRco and the ACF as well as between individual GDRco sample sites. Age was the most significant quantitative predictor of RPIs. The analyses indicated that Sitka spruce in this region is capable of producing the desired RPIs at an optimal age. Quantity requirements were calculated from several sources and results indicated that the region’s inventory is sufficient for domestic manufacturing needs.
Management objectives and site-specific silvicultural prescriptions may be key in achieving the desired results in accelerated time frames to meet GDRco management goals (GDRco FMP, 2023).",Rings per inch ; Forest Management ; Forestry Sector ; Picea Sitchensis ; Sitka Spruce ; Steel-string guitar ; Guitar manufacturing ; Acoustic guitar ; tonewood ; California ; Humboldt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/17
"Assessing the Potential for Bigleaf Maple Syrup Production in Humboldt County, CA","Reinhart, David A ; Ramos-Cool, Juan A ; Richardson, Liam H","The bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum, Pursh) is the largest maple of the Pacific Northwest. While it has generally been treated as a nuisance in timber harvesting operations, a small amount of research has been conducted on its sugaring ability in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia. This research has yet to reach further south in the species' range. This study aims to help a California landowner understand which maple trees on his property produce the most maple sap, to gauge what environmental factors contribute to maple sap production, and to find greater implications for the production of maple sap in Northern California. Over six weeks of collection from February to March 2025, we tapped 24 bigleaf maple trees in Humboldt County, California, where we measured their sap yield. A Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship between the amount of sap and temperature, tree characteristics, and site type. The only variable found to be significant (α = 0.05) was the difference between the average minimum and maximum temperature in the collection period (r = –0.91, p = 0.013). Neither DBH nor riparian influence was significantly correlated with daily sap yield. Our findings highlight temperature as the primary driver of sap flow, with lower and more stable temperatures correlating with higher sap production. While sap production in the southern part of the species' range is not suitable for large-scale commercial expansion, it may support small-scale, hobbyist operations.",maple sugaring ; sap yield ; freeze-thaw cycles ; Forest Management ; Other Plant Sciences ; temperature differential ; Forest Biology ; non-timber forest products ; Other Forestry and Forest Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/31
Impact of an herbicide treatment in an annual grass invaded sagebrush steppe,"Santia, Jordan Dino","Globally, rangelands are being threatened by invasive annual grasses (IAGs) that alter fire regimes, drive vegetation type conversion, and alter ecosystem function. This study evaluates vegetation responses to an Imazapic treatment applied in 2020 to control a population of Taeniatherum caput-medusae, an IAG, that flourished following a severe wildfire in 2013. The site, located on a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) grazing allotment east of Klamath Falls, Oregon, has been monitored annually using the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) protocol since the Summer of 2022. Over this period, very little T. caput-medusae has been detected while bare ground has declined, indicating an effective herbicide treatment and positive site recovery. Species richness has also increased along with total vegetation cover, specifically of native perennial grasses, indicating establishment of desired vegetation. However, increasing populations of invasive species like Bromus tectorum and Lactuca serriola indicate a potential secondary invasion that requires continued monitoring and management interventions. Targeted grazing, alternative herbicide options, and sagebrush plantings are all management tools that could support ongoing restoration of this sagebrush steppe ecosystem.",Natural Resources and Conservation ; Weed Science ; Botany,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/32

Rending the Social Fabric Vigilante Strikebreaking in 1930s California,"Claybrook, Abigail Ivie","During the 1930s, employers across the United States organized against the National Labor Relations Board and the renewed labor movement. These employers utilized several different strikebreaking techniques, including vigilante violence. California, an economic powerhouse with an established history of vigilantism, produced a particularly robust antilabor network. A cluster of corporations and employer associations formed connections with local vigilante organizations, and mobilized them against workers during periods of labor unrest.
Secondary sources on vigilantism in 1930s California tend to focus on antilabor violence in Central and Southern California. However, the strikebreaking techniques and vigilantism typically associated with these regions carried over to Northern California as well, highlighting the sheer effectiveness of the state's antilabor network. The pervasive nature of this network meant that antilabor violence was an omnipresent threat, hazarding the labor movement and dealing a blow to the greater social fabric.
This paper provides an overview of antilabor violence in California. The latter half of the paper surveys episodes of antilabor violence in Northern California specifically, with an emphasis on towns typically omitted from secondary sources.",Vigilante ; California ; Associated Farmers ; Labor History ; Strikebreaking ; Vigilantism ; Northern California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/16
Pulling Back the Redwood Curtain The Chinese Experience in Humboldt in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries,"Chu, Christopher J","Chinese immigrants were integral to many industries of early California. In Humboldt, they worked in industries such as logging, fishing, and railroads, and provided essential services, such as farming, gathering, or laundry, to the local economy. Chinese immigrants in Humboldt County during the late 19th and early 20th centuries faced systemic discrimination that became a defining feature of the region's identity. State legislation, including the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, along with national economic instability, particularly the Long Depression (1873–1896) and xenophobic policies in California influenced legislation and attitudes in Humboldt County. These forces combined with long-held local prejudices and competition between Euro-American and Chinese laborers in Humboldt, culminated in the Chinese Expulsion Event of 1885, which marked a pivotal moment in the county's history. This event solidified a legacy of anti-Chinese sentiment that persisted for over half a century, leading to the exclusion of Chinese communities, and shaping the region's social and cultural identity.",Labor ; Chinese ; Cultural History ; Chinese-American ; Eureka ; Race ; Labor History ; Social History ; Anti-Chinese ; Asian History ; United States History ; History ; California ; Humboldt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/23

Opening Up Information Literacy Empowering Students through Open Pedagogy,"Fields, Erin ; Harper, Adair","Open pedagogy and critical information literacy are influenced by critical pedagogy, which advocates for a disruption of information authority and privilege in the classroom and the creation of an environment that empowers students to be equal participants in their own learning. With the open education movement and the affordances of networked technologies, open pedagogy has the potential to enable students to be active co-creators of knowledge, engaging in information literacy practices of finding, analyzing, and sharing knowledge. Moving beyond an individualistic skills-based approach to information literacy, open pedagogy provides students with opportunities to not only reflect on their understanding of the political, social, and cultural dimensions of information but also to authentically engage in enacting change in the information landscape. In this article, we provide an overview of open pedagogy and information literacy theory, outlining how they intersect and the ways in which open pedagogy might facilitate critical aspects of information literacy instruction in librarianship.

To review thesis statements, both students and the instructors utilized a set of questions aimed at examining the effectiveness of the argument. Results of the study will determine whether students improved thesis writing ability. It will also establish whether feedback, both from their peers and from instructors, helped students revise their thesis, and if think-pair-share was successful in an online environment.",Credit courses ; Thesis statement ; Library instruction ; Information literacy ; Scholarship of Teaching and Learning ; Feedback,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sotl_ip/vol2/iss1/4
One Step at a Time A Case Study of Incorporating Universal Design for Learning in Library Instruction,"Peter, Samantha H ; Clement, Kristina A.","This paper introduces the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), an inclusive pedagogical principle that works to make instruction accessible for all by incorporating different needs of learners into instructional design. This article provides a brief analysis of the literature on UDL within the field of academic libraries and focuses specifically on library instruction. The paper then concludes with a comprehensive case study of the authors’ journey to actively incorporate UDL into their information literacy instruction sessions over a two-semester period, including lessons learned throughout their process.",Disability Studies ; Information Literacy ; Accessibility ; Library instruction ; Information literacy ; Scholarship of Teaching and Learning ; Academic libraries ; Inclusive pedagogy ; Universal design for learning,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sotl_ip/vol2/iss1/3
Making Methods Relevant Undergraduate Research Methods and the Content Analysis Project,"Courtright, Kevin E. ; Mackey, David A.","Teachers of undergraduate research methods classes may struggle at times to keep their courses engaging and to have students view the material as relevant to the occupations they will soon enter. This article discusses a content analysis assignment and how it offers a way for students to demonstrate critical thinking and acquire data analysis skills. Through the use of multiple high-impact learning practices, the assignment requires students, individually or in a group, to identify data appropriate for content analysis and then, with faculty guidance, develop research questions, manage the data, conceptualize and operationalize themes, perform content analysis, draw conclusions from the data, and assess the validity and reliability of their work. We discuss the benefits and potential pitfalls of the assignment and analyze data (both quantitative and qualitative) derived from student evaluations of their content analysis project.

"Recent sediments of Humboldt Bay, Eureka, California","Thompson, Robert Wayne","Humboldt Bay is a coastal lagoon, 14 mi. long and a maximum of 4 mi. wide. The bay has three distinct segments, South, Entrance, and Arcata Bays, each of which occupies the seaward end of one or more stream valleys cut into Plio- Pleistocene paralic sediments. The segments are linked by narrow tidal channels which are bounded by a barrier spit on the west and by high valley interfluves on the east. Climate of the area is rainy temperate . Tides are of the mixed type with a mean range of 6.5 ft.
Textural variations of the surface sediments in South and Arcata Bays correlate generally with bay-floor morphology. Bottoms of the inward branching tidal channels are covered by gravelly, shelly sand which becomes finer and more muddy with increasing distance from t he tidal inlet. Clayey silt predominates on the tidal flats, and highly organic silty clay or clayey peat occurs in the few remaining salt marshes. Tidal flat sediments are olive gray to black and thoroughly stirred by the rich bay infauna. The general pattern of decreasing grain size with increased elevation and distance away from the inlet is controlled by tidal currents. Exceptions to the general pattern and marked textural differences between tidal flat sediments in various of the bay segments result from: direct sediment discharge by entering streams, variable intensi ty of wave action, corrmercial oyster harvesting, and variations in flushing time. Dredged channels have larger components of both gravel and mud than their undredged counterparts.
Study of old maps and aerial photographs coupled with nearly ubiquitous evidence of marsh erosion indicate the bay is in approximate equilibrium, that is, filling at rates the order of 0.2-0.4 cm/yr commensurate with relative sea level rise. Most of the sediment comes indirectly from the Eel and Mad Rivers by way of littoral and tidal currents . Direct measurements show local accretion and erosion rates up to 4 cm/ yr and 11 cm/yr respectively. These fluctuate on a seasonal basis in response to alternating wind-wave patterns and reflect 'in-bay' relocation of materials.
Presence of extensive tidal flats and salt marsh imply former higher rates of accretion and bay infill. The recent change toward equilibrium conditions may relate to sediment removal by dredging and/or to a reduction in sed iment supply caused by northward shift of the Mad River course.",Oceanography ; Environmental Sciences ; Geography ; Pacific Ocean -- Humboldt Bay ; Oceanography -- California -- Humboldt Bay ; Humboldt Bay (Calif.) ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Sedimentation and deposition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/archivepub/12

The History of the Trinity Highway A Study in Transportation Dynamics,"Wilutus, Richard","Although the primary focus of this thesis is a history of California 299--the Trinity Highway, I have studied the construction of that road in the context of the history of transportation between Weaverville and Humboldt Bay. The history of a transportation network is not only a history of connections between people and places but also, in this remote region, the vital link connecting wilderness with civilization.
Ever since the settlement of the Weaverville area in 1848, its residents have sought reliable transportation to Humboldt Bay's seaport and merchandise. During this period a road has connected these two places for less than half that time; only since 1923 has it been possible to travel by road from the sea inland to the seat of Trinity County. Consequently a history of the Trinity Highway must include sufficient background to explain the delay in building this route, despite the acknowledged need for such an artery by the area's residents and both local and state governments. Thus when I refer to the Trinity Highway, I am, in fact , alluding to the more general concept of a transportation link that directly connects the two areas.
This thesis attempts to accomplish the following goals: 1) present a history of the development of transportation within the Humboldt-Trinity cultural and physical landscape; iv 2) analyze the dynamics of route location with an emphasis on the construction of Highway 299; and 3) show and explain the significance of the highway on economic and cultural patterns.
A history of a road connotes a description of the labor, materials, and mechanical construction of the route. While construction techniques and problems are discussed, prefer to study the history of transportation from a more humanistic approach. By determining the needs and desires of the population in relation to actual transportation improvements over time, I can reconstruct and interpret much of the region's cultural and economic history.
While, in a sense, this thesis is a regional history, the study will be limited exclusively to the effects of transportation on the population and communities within the thoroughfare's area. Before the highway was completed in 1923, the transportation link was more diffuse, involving numerous mule trails and various attempts at constructing private toll roads and railways. Thus this thesis begins with a general description of the region's pioneering transportation, and just as the road caused travelers to funnel into a narrow path, this paper then narrows its focus and concentrates on today's Trinity Highway.",Humboldt County ; Arcata ; Transportation Engineering ; Weaverville ; Trinity County ; Highway ; mining ; Mining Engineering ; Community and Regional Planning ; 299 ; Urban ; Geological Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/speccoll_mono/3

"Recent sediments of Humboldt Bay, Eureka, California","Thompson, Robert Wayne","Humboldt Bay is a coastal lagoon, 14 mi. long and a maximum of 4 mi. wide. The bay has three distinct segments, South, Entrance, and Arcata Bays, each of which occupies the seaward end of one or more stream valleys cut into Plio- Pleistocene paralic sediments. The segments are linked by narrow tidal channels which are bounded by a barrier spit on the west and by high valley interfluves on the east. Climate of the area is rainy temperate . Tides are of the mixed type with a mean range of 6.5 ft.
Textural variations of the surface sediments in South and Arcata Bays correlate generally with bay-floor morphology. Bottoms of the inward branching tidal channels are covered by gravelly, shelly sand which becomes finer and more muddy with increasing distance from t he tidal inlet. Clayey silt predominates on the tidal flats, and highly organic silty clay or clayey peat occurs in the few remaining salt marshes. Tidal flat sediments are olive gray to black and thoroughly stirred by the rich bay infauna. The general pattern of decreasing grain size with increased elevation and distance away from the inlet is controlled by tidal currents. Exceptions to the general pattern and marked textural differences between tidal flat sediments in various of the bay segments result from: direct sediment discharge by entering streams, variable intensi ty of wave action, corrmercial oyster harvesting, and variations in flushing time. Dredged channels have larger components of both gravel and mud than their undredged counterparts.
Study of old maps and aerial photographs coupled with nearly ubiquitous evidence of marsh erosion indicate the bay is in approximate equilibrium, that is, filling at rates the order of 0.2-0.4 cm/yr commensurate with relative sea level rise. Most of the sediment comes indirectly from the Eel and Mad Rivers by way of littoral and tidal currents . Direct measurements show local accretion and erosion rates up to 4 cm/ yr and 11 cm/yr respectively. These fluctuate on a seasonal basis in response to alternating wind-wave patterns and reflect 'in-bay' relocation of materials.
Presence of extensive tidal flats and salt marsh imply former higher rates of accretion and bay infill. The recent change toward equilibrium conditions may relate to sediment removal by dredging and/or to a reduction in sed iment supply caused by northward shift of the Mad River course.",Oceanography ; Environmental Sciences ; Geography ; Pacific Ocean -- Humboldt Bay ; Oceanography -- California -- Humboldt Bay ; Humboldt Bay (Calif.) ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Sedimentation and deposition,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/archivepub/12

The History of the Trinity Highway A Study in Transportation Dynamics,"Wilutus, Richard","Although the primary focus of this thesis is a history of California 299--the Trinity Highway, I have studied the construction of that road in the context of the history of transportation between Weaverville and Humboldt Bay. The history of a transportation network is not only a history of connections between people and places but also, in this remote region, the vital link connecting wilderness with civilization.
Ever since the settlement of the Weaverville area in 1848, its residents have sought reliable transportation to Humboldt Bay's seaport and merchandise. During this period a road has connected these two places for less than half that time; only since 1923 has it been possible to travel by road from the sea inland to the seat of Trinity County. Consequently a history of the Trinity Highway must include sufficient background to explain the delay in building this route, despite the acknowledged need for such an artery by the area's residents and both local and state governments. Thus when I refer to the Trinity Highway, I am, in fact , alluding to the more general concept of a transportation link that directly connects the two areas.
This thesis attempts to accomplish the following goals: 1) present a history of the development of transportation within the Humboldt-Trinity cultural and physical landscape; iv 2) analyze the dynamics of route location with an emphasis on the construction of Highway 299; and 3) show and explain the significance of the highway on economic and cultural patterns.
A history of a road connotes a description of the labor, materials, and mechanical construction of the route. While construction techniques and problems are discussed, prefer to study the history of transportation from a more humanistic approach. By determining the needs and desires of the population in relation to actual transportation improvements over time, I can reconstruct and interpret much of the region's cultural and economic history.
While, in a sense, this thesis is a regional history, the study will be limited exclusively to the effects of transportation on the population and communities within the thoroughfare's area. Before the highway was completed in 1923, the transportation link was more diffuse, involving numerous mule trails and various attempts at constructing private toll roads and railways. Thus this thesis begins with a general description of the region's pioneering transportation, and just as the road caused travelers to funnel into a narrow path, this paper then narrows its focus and concentrates on today's Trinity Highway.",Humboldt County ; Arcata ; Transportation Engineering ; Weaverville ; Trinity County ; Highway ; mining ; Mining Engineering ; Community and Regional Planning ; 299 ; Urban ; Geological Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/speccoll_mono/3

How Biden wants us to think about Ukraine’s conflict,"Shea, Rainer","President Joe Biden’s rhetorical style when talking to the American people about the conflict in Ukraine is one which can be compared to that of President George W. Bush in regards to the perpetrators of the September 11, 2001 attacks. During Biden’s speech about Ukraine in March of 2022, he conveyed an idea parallel to that which Bush conveyed: an enemy of the United States has committed a transgression which can’t go unpunished, and the “free world” needs to fight back at any cost. In order to make this case, Biden used the speech to counter Putin’s arguments for a Russian intervention in Ukraine, invoked memories of the fight against Soviet Russia, and talked about the conflict’s victims. Biden utilized pathos, ethos, and logos to build an argument for a sustained military aid commitment in Ukraine.",Russia ; International Relations ; Ukraine ; conflict ; International relations ; rhetoric,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/1
"Rhetorical Analysis of Choosing to go to the Moon ""and do the Other Things""","Kona, Skyler M","On September 12, 1962, president John F. Kennedy visited Rice University in Houston, Texas, and delivered what is commonly known as one of the most iconic speeches in American history. The speech, titled “Address at Rice University on the Nation's Space Effort”, but more widely known as “We Choose to go to the Moon”, was an attempt to gain further support for the nation's efforts in the Space Race against the Soviet Union. In his speech, Kennedy uses various techniques in order to further boost the audience's understanding of the situation, as well as, crucially, inspiring them to lend their support to these efforts. The speech today is seen as a symbol of victory, given that since then, America has successfully landed the first astronauts on the Moon, but at the time the speech was given, it was difficult to gain public support while the nation was losing the Space Race. This paper is an examination on the rhetoric of the speech, and why it worked well.

The Power of a Podcast,"Donlon, Breanna","This paper examines the correlation between the Your Own Backyard podcast and the rebooting of the Kristin Smart missing persons case. This case had gone cold and seemingly ignored for nearly 25 years, until 2019 when the podcast was created. The host conducted immense amounts of research to try and figure out what happened to Kristin, and in doing so, brought her case back to to the public’s attention. The actions of the podcast host caused the police to become more active on the case again. Because of the podcast, the prime suspect was finally arrested and will be held on trial.
Podcasting has become such a prevalent part of our media intake, with an even bigger impact on us than we might think. Podcasting seems to be becoming a very powerful form of communication. To examine this, we will focus on the history of podcasting, with the intent to show how podcasting can now be considered a form of journalism. Additionally, we will compare printed media with podcast media and how they differ when it comes to bringing awareness to missing persons cases.",Communication ; Journalism ; True Crime ; Podcasting ; Kristin Smart,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/23
Communication Classes That Help With Employment,"Savin, Cole","The reasoning for this paper is to influence you to take communication classes not only for credits or units for your major, but to further your knowledge, skills, and experience as a person. To start off this paper I talk about an interview with a manager about interviews and resumes. Then I talk about all of the communication classes that you can take and how it helps. These communication classes that are mentioned in this paper will help you the most in your employment wherever that may be. This paper will go over what employers look for in you as well as what will help you during employment. I will also talk about 4 skills that you will learn when taking communication classes (problem solving skills, the ability to work in a team setting, communication skills, and adaptability). The Communication classes that will be vital to take are Communication 490, Communication 206 Group communication, Communication 110 public speaking, Communication 120 and 322 intercultural communication, and Communication 324 nonverbal communication.

Shifting A Culture,"Arjomand, Ardeshir J","What is popular culture and how does it influence us? How can we be more critically aware consumers of media messages? Are we always ""online"", or is there some way we can disconnect? These are the questions I've attempted to define through my research and experience studying contemporary ""pop culture"". Consider this a beginner’s guide on how to become aware of and deal with the constant bombardment of media messages, and how to become a filter for content, rather than a sponge. As critical consumers of media we can cater our consumption to better suit our needs and lifestyles. This paper was mainly intended to raise awareness, but also to motivate and inspire us to: disconnect from the noise of society, to get out in nature, and to be positive role models for future generations. I’ve come to the conclusion that you can never fully disconnect, but we can get close if we really try. The important thing is to find a healthy balance, once we become aware of the pervasiveness of media influence in our lives.",Communication ; Mass ; Culture ; Popular ; Media ; Influence,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/17
Like a Virgin Comparing Cross-Cultural Virginity,"Tejada, Anastasia M","Studies have been conducted about the social construct of virginity inside the United States and cross-culturally. Investigations comparing the United States with these other cultures are limited and focus on the United States as the ideal representation of virginity in men and women. I aim to expand upon the current research provided by adding a new perspective to the analysis. The objective of conducting this analysis is to provide a global perspective defining the connotations of virginity cross-culturally. This study focused on the cultural, religious, and societal impacts on virginity collected through qualitative methods in the cultures of Arab-Americans, Latinx-Americans, and Malawi villages. The concluding evidence supported the theory that although there are specific gender expectations tied to each culture’s version of virginity, in an overarching analysis, the core ideals are too similar to be ignored. Overall, all of the cultures represented in this study viewed women’s virginity as a gift and the women as sexually submissive to men. While male virginity was seen as a failure to men’s masculinity and the men themselves must be a modern day Casanova.",Virginity ; Gender ; Communication ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Intersectionality ; Culture ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Race,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/16
A History Cannabis as a Cultural Communication Artifact,"Harper, Morgan L","This essay aims to detail the mechanics, structure, history, and ideology of cannabis from a socio-cultural perspective within the United States. However, it does contain some content that I believe will correlate with an international perspective. My emphasis in conducting this research is to look at the ways in which cannabis acts as a societal communication artifact, and in doing so, how it has formed a vast and highly identifiable culture. I believe that Cannabis acts as a communication tool both socially and interpersonally, with both notions being equally important to the culture overall. Cannabis has language, looks, and sounds, that come along with it, and these are vital aspects of what makes cannabis a communicative culture. With the recent societal advances in cannabis becoming widely decriminalized and regulated, the cannabis industry is moving from the hills to board room and consumer demographics are broad as ever. I am interested in exploring the ways in which the social and cultural component of cannabis was developed and how this has shifted and evolved, all while staying relatively true to its roots.",Communication ; Artifact ; Subculture ; Culture ; Cannabis ; Socio-Cultural,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/30
Countercultural Representation,"McGriff, Ethan A","Counter cultures have been prevalent throughout modern American history. Accompanied with music, these movements break the barriers of time and live on. Starting with an anecdote, the rapper Lil peep is given as an example of what the movements and music has led up to. To highlight modern movements that lead to that, the flower power movement is given first light. This leads into the punk/ hip-hop era, which gives way for the emocore movement that ultimately defines what our current generation considers to be the counterculture. Movements and music change over time and along the way people get hurt. Essentially music that aligns itself with a movement starts as counter cultural and gains mainstream popularity where it gets sold to death and gives birth to a new genre.",Punk ; Music ; Communication ; Emocore ; Counterculture ; Intercultural Communication ; Flower Power ; Cultural Artifact,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/3
"Children’s Film Media’s Influence on Gender, Race, and Identity","Kovis, Sara M","Whether conscious of it or not, media images have been working our entire lives to construct our attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of the world around us. What is the significance of the relationship between media consumption and how we interact in society? Applying communication theories and research into traditional and digital media is vital in understanding the realities around us. It explains where societal norms and values stimulate and how they trigger new behavioral changes. Ideologies are the mixed concepts and elements that create meaning in society. Today, people's ideological feelings produce pre-dated ideologies rather than their ideas. These are formed unconsciously by other social foundations, like their environment and the media, that surround and shape them. Not only does the media play a significant role in the views of others, but it is also a basis for forming our identities and place in a social context. Enculturation, first coined by anthropologist William Ogburn, is ""the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary to that culture and its worldviews"" (Enculturation, Google Arts & Culture, 2022). Today, enculturation and information about cultures other than one's own are first introduced to children through the media.",Critical and Cultural Studies ; Communication ; Gender ; Worldview's ; Male-gaze ; Cultivation Theory ; Racial Representation ; Communication Technology and New Media ; Symbolic Annihilation ; Gender Norms ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; Children's Media ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Enculturation ; Race,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/31
Stereotyping Gender Roles Children's Commercial Advertisement,"McClelland, Lucky J","Heteronormativity gives the individual in our society a binary optional choice: the first choice being the socially accepted ‘norm’ that follows the heteronormative binary, and the second being the socially disfavored choice of being deemed ‘abnormal’ if one chooses to go against this heteronormative binary. In return, we as a socially constructed society then deem the binary option of the ‘norm’ as the culturally preferred ‘good’ choice, while at the same time deem the other binary option of the ‘abnormal’ as the socially constructed ‘bad’ choice. This occurs both intentionally and unintentionally. The purpose behind my area of focus is to identify that the binary stereotyping of heteronormative gender roles in children’s commercial advertisement is resulting in young children having an essentialized heteronormative embedded ideology. With children’s commercial advertisements exclusively representing the heteronormative non-intersectional gender role narratives, this identity exclusion is leading children to reject any form of intersectional identity that doesn’t fit in the heteronormative binary bracket, as a subordinate socially ostracized form of gender and or sex identity for a child not to follow.",Gender ; Communication ; Intersectionality ; Stereotype ; Heteronormativity ; Advertisement ; Children,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/6
Healthy Environmental Communication Practices,"Magana, Michelle Monique","The goal of my academic research is to highlight the importance of appropriate, scientifically correct and accurate communication when discussing Environmental Health. If we want to begin making changes to help our environment to become more sustainable and ultimately provide more years of existence we must stop the lies, propaganda and spread of misinformation. “Communication constructs a social world that is relational, collaborative, strategic, symbolic, and adaptive” (Learning Outcomes in Communication). The objective is to understand the discourse on environmental issues and try to use our communication discipline to engage and dissect this issue from a Communication perspective. Our standards when talking about environmental issues should be high due to the severity. Recognizing discourse and critically analyzing the messages we are consuming on climate change is important for our own interpretation. As for writers with any type of platform it is our responsibility to create accurate messages for audiences to absorb and make sense of. When communicating about the environment our ethical principles and values should be present. As a society it is very important to practice sharing knowledgeable information to provide truth. Political gain and financial gain should be stopped when compromising our environmental health. We can make a difference if we work to disrupt this discourse and use academia to help save our planet. It is unethical to destroy a whole civilization’s environment for private financial gain. All humans will suffer the consequences of this discourse one day if we do not aim to be accurate and appropriate when communicating about environmental health.",Communication ; communication	 environmental health		 public discourse	 rhetoric 	 media literacy		environmental justice,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/21

"Bisexuality, Intersectionality, and the Bechdel Test in Jane the Virgin","Mallory, Catherine E, Ms.","Abstract
For this project I have looked at the show Jane the Virgin through a critical lens, and analyzed the characters in the show, the stereotypes portrayed about Latino culture, the stereotypes towards bisexuality, how intersectionality is involved, and the Bechdel-Wallace test. Throughout this paper I will examine a few specific characters and look at how stereotypes, of certain kinds, are portrayed, and how others are completely turned on it’s head. I apply terms such as intersectionality, stereotype, and sexuality to the characters and what they go through, throughout the course of the show. I have found that there are a few characters that represent the bi-sexual community, others from the LGBTQIA++ community, and discuss how they are shown positively in the show. I also use a critical cultural lens and look at common stereotypes that are made about the Latino culture, and how this show applies many of them, but also shows characters fighting those stereotypes and proving that not everyone from this culture fits those assumptions.",Communication ; Gender ; Bechdel Test ; Intersectionality ; Telenovela ; Stereotypes,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/20
I’m Not a Tragedy Speaking Up About Ableist Microaggressions,"Colwell, Kasandra Marguerite","Have you heard of ableist microaggressions? Let me tell you about them, as someone who has experienced them. I have a bi-lateral dislocating knee condition that I was born with. I can walk, but sometimes I need additional stability or reduction of pain while getting around, in which case I tend to use a cane. I have had many othering interactions while using a mobility aid in public, whether that be a knee brace, a cane, or crutches. While it often seemed the stranger didn’t mean any harm, the question is how many invasive questions and comments from strangers can one person take? Do they even listen to the response? I notice the different ways I’m treated depending on the visibility or invisibility of my disability. In this paper I will tell stories of some of these interactions during a time when my disability was more visible, and I connect these stories to ableist microaggressions domains and experiences shared in previous research. This paper will take a different route than most academic papers, opting instead for a narrative approach. Considering these are deeply personal experiences, it feels better to tell my story in this way.",microaggressions ; chronic pain ; disability visibility ; Other Mental and Social Health ; Other Theatre and Performance Studies ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication ; mental health ; Disability Studies ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Mental and Social Health ; Critical and Cultural Studies ; ableism ; physical disability ; Liberal Studies ; Creative Writing ; Communication ; Nonfiction ; personal narrative ; Social Psychology and Interaction ; Performance Studies ; Medical Education ; Other Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/27
Challenges Faced by Recently Emancipated Youth,"Peña, Williams ; Butkiewicz, Jerry Walter, III","In this academic research paper, we will be exploring the challenges faced by recently emancipated youth. We chose this topic because of the fact that this is not often spoken about or taught to the general public. This lack of attention to these issues creates hurdles when attempting to solve these sensitive issues. Considering this, we thought it would be a strong choice for further research and review. We explored many obstacles these new adults face. One such issue that we would like to touch on is the unstable housing situation of these recently emancipated individuals. Another prudent example is the issue of healthcare. While some support systems are in place, more should be done in the form of education of these valuable resources available. In layman's terms, foster children have their basic needs covered by the state until the day they turn 18. On their 18th birthday, they are considered adults and can no longer be supported under the foster care system. This is not a system that caters to the success of foster children, this is a system that does the bare minimum. Let's explore how we can do better for foster children and subsequently be better as a society.",Foster Care System ; Communication ; Vulnerable Youth ; Independent Living Programs ; Aging Out ; Foster Youth ; Social Work ; Emancipation ; Health Communication ; Mentorship ; Health Care ; Social Welfare ; Public Affairs ; Homelessness ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication ; Transitional Housing Programs,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/26

However, we as the consumers and fans of the industry, tend to lack further examinations on the dynamics of the economic roles within sports. We sometimes become caught up in the glory of sports and never truly take the time to examine all of the money that goes into the industry. This paper will illustrate the ways in which the sports industry disburses their funds. From the cost of being a fan, to the payments of athletes, and the roles that sports economics play in a professional sports team’s community as a whole. It will then further question whether or not sports are too costly for our own pure enjoyment/entertainment.",Fans ; Communication ; Stadiums ; Economies ; Sports ; Athletes ; COVID-19 ; Finances ; Sports Industry ; Costs,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/4
Parenting in the Public Eye,"Stauff, Sarah","This paper examines how parents share photos, videos and information about their children on social media websites, called sharenting. COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act is mentioned specifically because it does not protect children’s online presence from their parents. Multiple types of sharenting are examined such as; posts for family and friends to view, informational blogs and posts, punishment posts, and YouTube vlogging, or blogging in a video format. Vlogging is dissected by studying three different family vlog YouTube channels and the content that they create. The confidence and sense of self worth of children whose parents participate in sharenting is discussed as well as both present and future repercussions of these posts. Additionally, threats to children’s safety are looked at from how schools, activities and addresses are sometimes available to find on parent’s profiles on websites like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. As well as safety risks, there are often risks of bullying for the child because of the often sensitive nature of these posts. All of these have the potential to be very detrimental to children and their emotional development.

HSU Communicative Practices Administration Must Include the Student Voice,"Medina, Q","This paper examines the impact of communication practices of university administration (openness and inclusion) on the student body’s sense of satisfaction, value, and connectedness by focusing on a selected collection of past moments of communication from administration to students. A total of five current instances where official emails were sent out addressing a handful of the biggest impactful events at the university and the following reactions from the overall student body was used as the qualitative data to analyze the effectiveness of such communication choices. Results of the observations confirmed that the current practices of the university administration were no longer considered wholly acceptable or consistent with the values not only claimed by the university, but also those expressed and attached to the student body identity. More importantly, they showed the clear need for more value and inclusion to be put on student voices regarding big events and decisions made by administrators. The study concludes with the implications of what path the current practices will lead Humboldt State University if not addressed and altered to match the current organizational culture and environment.",Bureaucracy ; Communication ; Administration ; Organizational Communication ; HSU culture ; Organizational communication ; University administration ; Leadership Studies ; Organization Development ; Student voices ; Humboldt State University ; Student culture,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/19
Ripe for Consumption Separating Women from Autonomy,"Stibbard, Nicole Kasandra","This proposed position statement privileges the notion that the male gaze is a damning and damaging force for identifying women in both Western societies as well as within patriarchal societies. This particular exploration is driven by my perceived lack of the true effect that this gaze has socially and intrapersonally over women. The male gaze not only strips women of bodily integrity, bodily autonomy, but autonomy holistically. Beyond the stripping of autonomous worth, the male gaze, i.e. objectification and an autonomous reduction to body parts alone, all result in psychological and physiological damage for identifying women. Previous research in the Communication field focuses on the explicitness of women’s appearances and the drive for objectification and the male gaze to occur; therefore, how and what objectification creates for women’s realities is extremely neglected. In order to properly challenge, and hopefully dismantle: heteropatriarchy, heteropolarity, and heteronormativity which all motivate objectification, women’s reality via the male gaze requires more study to deduce the exact ways in which such objectification could and should be challenged. The aforementioned negative and damaging effects of the male gaze are: belief in rape myths and other anti-women myths relating to violence, bodily surveillance, body monitoring, self-objectification, anxiety, depression, disordered eating, and more. It will require continual autoethnographic accounts from identifying women to gather more of these effects. This form of research and account has the potential to free some anticipation and anxiety surrounding the feelings of isolation which may come from enduring such an oppressive force alone.",Communication ; Heteropatriarchy ; Heteronormativity ; Objectification ; Heteropolarity,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/22

Consumerism and Covid - 19  A Neoliberal Analysis,"Roy, Taylor M","This paper attempts to draw a line between consumer culture and COVID -19, while finding how it has been influenced by social media and targeted advertisements. Through exploring Foucault's understanding of neoliberalism and the homoeconomicus, articles and media news, this paper will have assessed the changes of consumer culture due to the “shelter in place” orders. Additionally, it will attempt to redefine Foucaults homoeconomicus to fit this new model as well as observe how electronic surveillance through social media platforms and their targeted ads will or have changed the landscape of neoliberalism. In summarizing the notable differences in the use of individuals' online presence versus the older model of focus groups we will see that society is providing immeasurable numbers of free labor hours. By analysing all of these different avenues, this paper will attempt to create predictions for what this “new” neoliberalism will look like not only for the current climate but what this will imply for the neoliberal climate of the future - that is the world we will be living in when things go back to “normal”.

"Mankind, Humans, Congressman It’s All Inclusive, Right Guys?","Thacker, Rachael","This paper takes a look at research surrounding the use of gendered language and how it impacts occupations and careers from ages as young as grade school, and all the way into adulthood. The use of gender-fair language creates a more gender inclusive attitude towards traditionally male occupations. The masculine generic language used in our culture perpetuates gender stereotypes among children as young as six and continues on into adulthood. Changing the language to include both women and men allows for both to self-identify beyond the stereotypical occupations and see themselves as successful. This can be seen in how children view occupations as gendered, in whether or not women apply for job advertisements that use masculine generic language, and even in the job itself when the job relies on students evaluating a teacher’s performance. Self-identification is important in regards to success, and language plays a role in this. Even gender-fair language is not fully inclusive as it reinforces the binary and causes erasure in marginalized groups such as the trans community or someone who identifies as nonbinary. Language is a powerful tool to uphold current power structures and make privileged bodies hyper visible.",Binary ; Gender ; Communication ; Masculine generic language ; Gender-fair language ; Work ; Occupation ; Normative language ; Stereotypes,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/15
"Non-Verbal Communication, Anxiety, Behavioral Changes within Covid Regulatory Changes","Stack, Sydney ; McCracken, Olivia","In the current era of education and social communication shifting into a virtual world the students entering the early elementary education system have experienced something that is new to all of us. Within the last two and a half years life as we have known it has vastly shifted. Virtual learning and communication, which is not something that is new, but something that was scarce prior to the Covid-19 pandemic is now the “new normal.” For many of the students affected, this way of learning has shaped much of their educational career. Changes like these are affecting areas of development within these young students; such as the development of their nonverbal communication, the increase of anxiety, alongside behavioral shifts. Throughout this paper we will be discussing and analyzing the current research and data alongside these new protocols, as well as their effects in the short term on those who are most vulnerable. Some of the new protocols and overall changes that we will be looking into are the use of masking, social distancing, distance learning, and the increase in screen time. Above all, the questions we are going to be looking at are: Have these changes affected early elementary students, and has it created limitations within their nonverbal communication, and increasing anxiety?

The Misrepresentation of Women in the Media and Women’s Rights,"Endicott, Hannah M","This paper is centered around the misrepresentation of women in the media and the implications that it has had on the treatment of women’s rights in society. The media is defined as television, movies, advertisements, etc. Women have been represented as being oversimplified through their stereotypical portrayal as housewives and mothers in the media, alongside being hypersexualized through their clothing and body image. Both of these forms of portrayals have had negative effects on women. Young girls are now being targeted as well through the explicit tones that the advertising of children’s toys creates. This paper aims to demonstrate how women have been disadvantaged through their stereotypical portrayal in the media and the ways in which that has led to their rights being disregarded in society. The overturning of the legal case Roe v. Wade is a prime example used in this paper to demonstrate a direct way in which women have been disadvantaged and the ways that their portrayals in the media may have led to this. This paper also aims to convince society that changes must be made to the ways that we show women in the media.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/33

Interpersonal Communication From Student to Host Family,"Magee, Tajma R","This research project aims to improve interpersonal communication between international students and their host families. Existing research and data shows that students can have a difficult time adjusting to their life abroad, whether it be within their host home or within the institution they are studying at. This can greatly affect their overall studying abroad experience and can affect the way they communicate with the members of their host family. Factors like the student’s academic performance in school and behavior in school may be affected as well. Identifying the issues that contribute to a negative experience in a host family’s home will provide study abroad programs, institutions connected with study abroad programs, host families and the international students themselves with the tools they need that are necessary to improve the overall communication within a host family and international student home. I will collect data from students in the California State University system studying abroad in three different locations: Spain, Japan and Costa Rica. I will also present a proposed questionnaire that would need to get approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) if I actually went through with this plan, I will include the link to the website to get that done below. My initial research showed that these are the most popular study abroad destinations among college students in California. I will dig in deep to track and identify the positive and negative elements of the study abroad experience that affect the behavior and communication between the international students and their host family. I will look into the students that returned from the program as well. This method will provide a deeper, more personable understanding of what aspects of the program, from the student’s perspective, and can be improved to increase the communication between these two parties. This collection of data, with recommendations, will be given to the California State University system, the international programs, and the participating host families in hopes of improving the quality of the travel abroad experience for international CSU students, and more specifically the communication they have with their host family.",Communication ; Sojourner ; Organizational Competence ; Pragmatic Competence ; Schema Theory ; Imagined Community,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/28

A Critical Analysis of Mobile Interpersonal Relationships through Uncertainty Reduction Theory,"Kee, Rachael L","Through the use of online dating apps, individuals are having the chance to begin, develop, and end interpersonal relationships without ever even meeting the partner in person. It is assumed that this is happening due to the lack of primary tension in initial contact, as uncertainty reduction can take place from behind a screen. This study sought to connect the theories between Uncertainty Reduction Theory and mobile interpersonal relationships. The axioms of Charles Berger’s theory come into play during online dating as the eight key variables of relationship development are utilized in most successful interpersonal relationships to further intimacy, in an attempt to reduce primary tension. To further connect, four information-seeking strategies can be utilized during the online dating experience as people have the ability to observe online interaction, seek information from a third party online source, talk directly to the person of interest, and browse the internet for information about them as well. Through these primary connections between URT and mobile interpersonal relationships, areas of interest for further research can be actions towards comparing those who reduce uncertainty in an online platform versus those who do in-person in a longitudinal study.",Communication ; Primary tension ; Mobile ; Online-dating ; Uncertainty reduction theory ; Interpersonal relationships,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/32
Group Involvement Cohesion & Tensions through Collaboration,"Hernandez, Edwin","The importance of teamwork and group involvement is essential not only in school to complete a common goal, but employers need to know that you have cooperation skills and the ability to collaborate with others in a diverse setting effectively. As my roommates and I arrived from different parts of California into a rural small county called Humboldt, we all came for the environment, but perhaps for distinctively altered reasons. We looked to develop improved relationships as well as group communication within the confines of our living space. Additionally, the goal was to maintain and manage a clean environment within our dorm room. For some of us, it's the first time living alone without our parents, however, we don't have them to clean up after ourselves anymore. Even though we each have our separate rooms, sharing and cleaning the kitchen, as well as the bathrooms, have already created certain tensions within our group.
The purpose of this research is to investigate how individuals within the collegiate academic level form relationships amongst their roommates. We are all different in our personal characteristics, however, the end goal is to maintain and manage a clean environment. With each passing day, we learn more from each other whether it’s flaws, skills, or strengths. We, in a sense, are forced to live with each other. Getting to know my roommates has been interesting. Each person is different and unique in their way. To co-exist in tranquility and create a safe space, we need to understand the importance of roles. We all need each other to do task chores because it will make for a suitable environment.

Pink Is The New Tax,"Burns, Eliana","Historically women in America have made colossal advances that have proven they are just as capable as men. Women had fought and continued to challenge the system since 1919 with the 19th Amendment giving them a right to vote. However, even with this crucial progression, womens’ oppression can be found all around us only in much more subtle ways such as “ the pink tax”. As of 2020 there are currently no federal laws to outlaw companies from charging different prices depending on which gender they are meant to be marketed to. This rhetorical analysis will first address the concept of gendered products, how the tax benefits from these products, and why gendering of products reinforce gender discrimination and stereotypes. A brief explanation as to why the tax is nicknamed “the tampon tax” is included. Next the economic effects of the tax especially in terms of over the course of an average lifetime.

By identifying and criticizing components of insurance, employment, and the fetishization of marketplace competition, I will make a Foucauldian analysis of the flawed power structures existing within a privatized health system. The goal of this article is to articulate and make clear the case for the implementation of a single-payer system in the United States, which would see a much vaster and more equitable breadth of positive health outcomes. New language will be introduced such as the idea of health outcomes and health justice. Both concepts encompass principles and values that should exist within a progressive healthcare system functioning within the borders of the wealthiest country in world history. The extent to which COVID-19 exposes what this paper considers to be inherent shortcomings and expected failures within the healthcare system is used as further evidence to encourage the reconstruction of the US healthcare system into that of a single payer infrastructure.",Critical and Cultural Studies ; Communication ; Foucauldian ; Health Justice ; Markets ; Un-insurance ; Single-Payer ; Health Communication ; Healthcare ; Subaltern ; State of Exception ; Neoliberalism,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/13

"Data Capitalism, Digital Health, and Marxism","Stanger, Samantha C","Abstract
When immersed in a capitalist society individuals often fail to see the ways in which they are exploited, and when these discussions do come into discourse they are often geared toward workplace labor. Less commonly do we consider the ways in which these problems arise in conjunction with free labor, mainly performed in digital spaces. While less often considered or discussed, the exploitation occurring in the digital world is real and has substantial consequences, particularly when the digital spaces involve sensitive information and data.  This paper aims to address how data capitalism functions in three different digital health spaces: online patient forums and support groups, mental health apps, and direct-to-consumer DNA sequencing companies. In order to show how patients are persuaded to join and contribute to these digital spaces there will be an investigation of the rhetorical strategies utilized in marketing tactics. We will consider the economic functioning of data capitalism through a basic Marxist perspective, which criticized the capitalist mode of production and exploitation of workers, or in this case the creators of data.",Communication ; capitalism ; marketing ; Direct-to-consumer genome sequencing ; free labor ; rhetoric,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/25
Dissecting Ideologies Embedded in Ford Advertisement,"Afsarzadeh, Sidney Rain Shabnam","The goal of this paper is to exemplify rhetorical criticism to examine an artifact. Specifically, this paper will use the method of ideological criticism to identify ideologies embedded in a commercial. In the case of this paper, the commercial being examined is a Ford truck commercial titled, Ford for the Builders, Built for America. This paper will identify and explain the ideologies used to advertise Ford trucks. It is important to be able to identify ideologies embedded in things like commercials in order to not be blind to cultivation theory. Which is a theory created by Professor George Gerber in the 1960s. Overall, the goal is to identify messages which are communicated through advertisement. Ford is one of the original American businesses and every person in this country who has been around television and or the internet has seen their ads. This paper will identify the meanings they are trying to portray with their ads. Along with why they would choose to communicate those ideologies in their advertisement. When a person is able to identify ideologies being portrayed by someone or something else they can be less affected by them. Moreover, this paper may teach a reader how to embed meaning into their own rhetoric by comprehending the dissecting of rhetoric.",Communication ; Ideological Criticism ; Ford ; Cultivation Theory,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_comm/29

Are characters overcoming adversity? Are there male characters experiencing complex emotions? I’m comparing these shows with most western films. That would usually tell stories through the white cisgendered straight male. I take examples from each show to how these characters are a step in the direction of proper representation.

Intercultural and International Communication in the Surrogacy Industry,"Baker, Jessica","Understanding the relationship between intercultural communication, international communication, and the proper way to discuss sensitive topics (infertility, surrogacy, LGBTQ+) in the surrogacy industry leads to strong communication. When communicating internationally or interculturally, there may be challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and cultural taboos. In order to avoid uncomfortable situations or miscommunication, knowing how to change the way we communicate with Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) is a necessity to navigate important conversations. In the surrogacy industry, knowing how to communicate interculturally and being culturally competent about sensitive topics such as infertility or loss can determine the success of a surrogacy journey and change a client's life hopefully positively. To show respect and support for others, it is important to approach these topics carefully and with knowledge. When discussing sensitive topics interculturally, the way we communicate changes from our dialog, vocabulary, tone, and approach. By consciously being aware of the changes that must be made, trust can be built when discussing sensitive topics and by showing someone your support, avoiding miscommunication, or misunderstandings due to differences in culture, sensitive topics can be better communicated interculturally.",Intercultural Communication ; Women's Studies ; LGBTQ+ ; and Transgender Studies ; and Ethnicity in Communication ; Surrogacy ; Gender ; Gay ; Cultural Competence ; Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT) ; Critical and Cultural Studies ; Bisexual ; International and Intercultural Communication ; Sexuality ; Race ; International Communication ; Lesbian ; Health Communication ; Interpersonal and Small Group Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/15

There has been an influx in communication tools, digital paradigms, and teaching methodologies in addition to relying on existing digital tools and methods to continue students' education while unable to meet in person. The level of remote learning and digital movement is unprecedented and the results have been varied and illuminating. Research has been conducted on student attitudes in the immediate aftermath of the emergency transition, on specific teaching tools, and on remote instruction in regards to learning outcomes, but the long term effects of the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19 lockdowns on student’s educational development and prospects are still unknown. There are also the existing privacy and safety concerns for digital tool interaction that extend to education that have been exacerbated by the emergency transition.

Often when people hear about the state of the climate there is a sense of dread that people have reported feeling. Most people feel as though the climate has reached the point of no return and that there is nothing that any one person can do to really make a difference. This paper will talk about some ways that have worked for people in getting them to do climate action while also enjoying the work that needs to be done. Some topics that will be discussed are environmental communication as well as climate action in specific communities. There will also be an analysis on how the conversation of climate change has been handled in the past and why it makes people feel as though there is no hope. By using examples of communities that have found a way to participate in climate action, the goal will be that everyone can feel like they can take part in caring for the climate while also caring for themselves.",Communication ; Community ; Joy ; Mass Communication ; Social Influence and Political Communication ; Environmental Communication ; Climate Action,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/8

Kendrick Lamar and the 2025 Super Bowl Halftime Show A Neo-Aristotelian Analysis,"Ashby, Nova","Rhetorical analysis is a form of criticism that has a goal of examining and explaining the relationship between a text, the author of that text, and the audience the text is being presented to. It allows for a deep dive into understanding the author's choices and intentions, whether that be informing, entertaining, or persuading, and how those things affect the audience. While written texts and verbal speeches are most often looked at for this type of analysis, other forms of communication can be analyzed as well such as songs, advertisements, films, and even social media posts. In that context, this essay will be examining the 2025 superbowl halftime show performance by Kendrick Lamar.  It will explain who Kendrick Lamar is, his accomplishments, why he was chosen for a rhetorical analysis, and the analysis itself. It will dive deeper into the meaning and significance of his performance and that performance will be interpreted using the Neo-Aristotelian approach. It will discuss why Lamar chose specific songs, lyrics, and signs to represent himself and his message, and it will further dive into what his message really was and the meaning behind his choices. Also being discussed is the results of his performance, both good and bad, and how it was received. At the end of this paper, it will briefly describe two other rhetorics that could be used to analyse Lamar’s halftime performance.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/6
Rhetoric and Gender Equality in Emma Watson's HeForShe Speech,"Ancheta, Alexa","This paper looks at Emma Watson's 2014 HeForShe speech at the United Nations and how she used different speaking techniques to promote gender equality. As a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador, Watson used her fame to encourage both men and women to support feminism. The paper breaks down how Watson made her message clear using the Five Canons of Rhetoric, including how she organized her speech, used language, and connected with her audience. It also discusses how she used credibility, emotion, and logic to persuade people. The paper explores how Watson’s speech encouraged men, especially younger ones, to care about gender equality, and it looks at both the positive reactions and the criticisms she faced. In the end, her speech helped change how people think about feminism and called for men and women to work together for equality.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/7
A Rhetorical analysis of Allyson Felix’s commencement speech at USC in 2022.,"Solares, Silvia","This paper looks at Allyson Felix’s 2022 commencement speech at the University of Southern California using the neo-Aristotelian method. Felix is a USC graduate and Olympic track star. During this commencement speech she shared her personal story about finding her voice and standing up for what she believes in. She was a very successful track and field athlete with many sponsors. She found her voice especially when it came to speaking out about pregnancy discrimination in sports. She explained clearly and with much detail how her experience with Nike led her to push for policy changes that now help other female athletes. She also created her own company with the values and standards she expects for herself.. This analysis breaks down her speech by looking at how she built credibility, connected emotionally, and organized her message to inspire graduates. Felix’s message about using your voice, even when it ‘shakes’, knowing when to create change and when to seek it and living a life with purpose was powerful and personal. Her speech was not only meaningful for the students listening that day but also important in showing how one person’s actions can make a big difference.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/8
A Moonshot in an Uncertain Time,"Brown, Griffin Thomas","This is a rhetorical analysis of John F. Kennedy’s speech at Rice University given on September 12th, 1962. This speech was chosen because of its cultural and temporal significance, and it has been analyzed in a myriad of ways according to the surrounding texts within the COMM 300 framework. The paper contains a synopsis of the rhetorical situation at the time, as well as an analysis of the speech using the 5 canons, symbolic convergence theory, and visual perspectives. Kennedy’s speech is deconstructed, and his juxtaposition of pride and careful optimism is studied intently below. In addition, Kennedy’s argument surrounding difficulty being an innate motivator and his calls for the American people to unite as one are looked at through the historical context they fall under as well as the societal ideals they seek to undermine.",Communication,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/9
"President Eisenhower’s Farewell Address, Is Hindsight 20/20?","Winslow, Max Seldon","While less famous than MLK's “I have a dream” speech or George Bush's “Axis of evil” speech, Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address stands as an equally important part of American speech history. Eisenhower’s farewell address holds great significance in terms of 20th-century American political development, from its direct appeal to the people in regard to the all-but prophetic prediction of the rise of the military industrial complex, to its standing as a “Last Hurrah” of small government traditional American conservatism. The United States may have changed entirely, yet Eisenhower’s farewell address stands in time as an unheeded warning to the American people, one that is as relevant now in 2025 as it was in 1961. In this paper, I intend to dive into Eisenhower’s farewell speech, examining it with a neo-Aristotelian lens. In the following paragraphs, I will describe the rhetorical situation faced by Eisenhower in 1961, interpret Eisenhower’s farewell address according to the 5 canons, and evaluate the overall lasting implications of his speech. Lastly, I shall discuss 2 additional rhetorical considerations in terms of how they apply to this speech, those being: The narrative paradigm and fidelity of his speech.",Eisenhower ; Communication ; Speech and Rhetorical Studies ; Address ; Discourse ; Rhetorical ; Speech ; Analysis,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/comm300/10

"The Paiute, Water Wars, and a Covered Up Agricultural Revolution","Chambers, Nicholas Anthony","Like many other Native Americans, the Bishop Paiute in California have long faced an uphill battle in retaining their federally given land rights, access to natural resources, and their ability to remain self-sufficient. Often Native peoples (the Paiute included) have faced a long history of presidential administrations or federal agencies tolerating or even assisting them, only for a small political change to occur and all positive treaties or relations towards them evaporate or turn hostile. Tribes (according to American law) are supposed to be sovereign and see their treaties upheld in perpetuity. However, the Paiute (like many other Native tribes) face different treatment from one generation to the other as American politics (and American views on Natives) shifts so rapidly, as this paper will explore.",History ; United States History ; Native American Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/senior_hist/2
Rending the Social Fabric Vigilante Strikebreaking in 1930s California,"Claybrook, Abigail Ivie","During the 1930s, employers across the United States organized against the National Labor Relations Board and the renewed labor movement. These employers utilized several different strikebreaking techniques, including vigilante violence. California, an economic powerhouse with an established history of vigilantism, produced a particularly robust antilabor network. A cluster of corporations and employer associations formed connections with local vigilante organizations, and mobilized them against workers during periods of labor unrest.
Secondary sources on vigilantism in 1930s California tend to focus on antilabor violence in Central and Southern California. However, the strikebreaking techniques and vigilantism typically associated with these regions carried over to Northern California as well, highlighting the sheer effectiveness of the state's antilabor network. The pervasive nature of this network meant that antilabor violence was an omnipresent threat, hazarding the labor movement and dealing a blow to the greater social fabric.
This paper provides an overview of antilabor violence in California. The latter half of the paper surveys episodes of antilabor violence in Northern California specifically, with an emphasis on towns typically omitted from secondary sources.",Vigilante ; California ; Associated Farmers ; Labor History ; Strikebreaking ; Vigilantism ; Northern California,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/16
Pulling Back the Redwood Curtain The Chinese Experience in Humboldt in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries,"Chu, Christopher J","Chinese immigrants were integral to many industries of early California. In Humboldt, they worked in industries such as logging, fishing, and railroads, and provided essential services, such as farming, gathering, or laundry, to the local economy. Chinese immigrants in Humboldt County during the late 19th and early 20th centuries faced systemic discrimination that became a defining feature of the region's identity. State legislation, including the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, along with national economic instability, particularly the Long Depression (1873–1896) and xenophobic policies in California influenced legislation and attitudes in Humboldt County. These forces combined with long-held local prejudices and competition between Euro-American and Chinese laborers in Humboldt, culminated in the Chinese Expulsion Event of 1885, which marked a pivotal moment in the county's history. This event solidified a legacy of anti-Chinese sentiment that persisted for over half a century, leading to the exclusion of Chinese communities, and shaping the region's social and cultural identity.",Labor ; Chinese ; Cultural History ; Chinese-American ; Eureka ; Race ; Labor History ; Social History ; Anti-Chinese ; Asian History ; United States History ; History ; California ; Humboldt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/capstone/23
"California Dreamin’ Industrialization, The Progressive Movement, and the Americanization of the Russian Molokans","Cutillo, Ryan","At the dawn of the twentieth century, a wave of Russian Molokan immigrants arrived in Southern California, bringing with them dreams of religious freedom, agrarian simplicity, and communal self-determination. What they encountered instead was a complex web of industrial ambition, Progressive idealism, and American social engineering. This paper traces the Molokans’ journey from the Caucasus to the barrios of Boyle Heights and the fields of Baja California, highlighting the often-overlooked intersections between philanthropy and profiteering, altruism and assimilation. Figures such as Rev. Dana Bartlett, C.P. de Blumenthal, and Peter A. Demens emerge not only as benefactors but as agents in a broader campaign to reshape immigrant identity in the image of American modernity. As the Molokans struggled to preserve their language, faith, and way of life amid English classes, labor contracts, and “citizen factories,” a generational divide widened—one marked by the fading echoes of Russian hymns in American schoolyards and the loss of cultural continuity to the demands of industrial capitalism and patriotic conformity. This study contends that the Molokan experience exemplifies the quiet unraveling of an immigrant community caught between spiritual conviction and the machinery of assimilation.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/histpaper/1

"Is mortality of a common shrub a heritable trait? An experimental evaluation of senescence using the coast willow, Salix hookeriana.","On, Maylin A. ; Polyack, RJ ; Galloway, Sarah ; Jules, Erik","In 2009, a common garden study involving Salix hookeriana (called “willows” from hereon) was initiated in which multiple clonal replicates were created and propagated for a total of 675 trees. Since 2009, numerous experiments and observations have been completed using the willows at the study site of Humboldt Bay Wildlife Refuge demonstrating that growth, phenology, and insect communities are influenced by genotype. Our study was aimed at understanding if senescence and mortality are correlated with both plant sex and genotype. In August of 2024, seven replicates from each of the ten genotypes in the experimental array were selected and the proportion of alive stems was measured. Tests that were used include an ANCOVA comparing biomass, sex, and genotype on proportion of stems alive, a linear regression comparing proportion of stems alive to biomass associated with genotype, and a chi-squared test comparing number of dead or alive trees versus plant sex. Ultimately, it was found that mortality and proportion of stems alive did not differ among sexes, however it did differ among genotypes.

This executive summary outlines ways that anxiety, fear, hopelessness and guilt impact student learning in environmental studies (ESS) programs, and immobilizes young people from getting engaged in climate solutions. We also suggest that ESS curriculum is itself partly responsible for these spiraling emotions among students. In response to the need to better understand this emotional register of teaching and learning about our climate crisis, we outline a set of college-level teaching strategies – titled “An Existential Toolkit for Climate Justice” – whose purpose is to help students and educators develop the resilience to cope with our climate emergency.",Eco-grief ; Environmental education ; Climate-anxiety ; Mental health ; Climate resilience ; Environmental Studies,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol1/iss1/6
Benefits of Cover Cropping Systems in Walnut Orchards as Sustainable Agricultural Practice,"Medic, Ana ; Baez Vega, Consuelo B","In recent years walnut orchards implemented cover crops in between rows to improve soil’s quality, lessen soil’s erosion, increase organic matter, manage nutrient movement and availability, enhance water retention, and expand microbe, insect, and flora diversity. Commonly selected cover crops in California are from families Poaceae, Brassicaceae, and Fabaceae. Considerations should be made when choosing a particular cover crop mixture to enhance multiple benefits and improve sustainable practices in orchard settings. An experiment was conducted in a walnut orchard to compare functionality and benefits of three systems multi-crop, monocrop, and no vegetation cover crop system. The following components were evaluated: cover crop and weed biomass, cover crop species field distribution, and ability to provide better coverage and weed suppression properties. Brassica mixture, clover and grasses showed highest presence in field conditions and excellent weed competition attributes, while peas and faba beans had low presence and did not compete well growing in a mixture with other cover crops. Multi-crop treatment demonstrated the highest dry and wet biomass as well as the greatest weed suppression. Recommendations are to carefully consider current practices in walnut orchards, to seasonally include vegetation cover rather than bare soil, and to choose multi-crop cover rather than monocrop. Implementation of multi-crop species as a sustainable practice would increase soil’s quality, improve biological management through rise of natural beneficial predators and enhance integrated pest management methods.",walnut orchard ; multi-crop ; Agricultural Science ; Sustainability ; monocrop ; Weed Science ; biomass ; weed competition ; Agronomy and Crop Sciences ; cover crops,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol1/iss1/5
Impacts of Student-Led Sustainability Efforts at Fresno State,"Acosta, Marissa E. ; Mayfield, Michael B. ; Teter, Feng ; Lozano, Juana ; Lucha, Alcira ; Alewine, Ayanna ; Weinman, Beth ; Lee, Devon ; Cordova, Robert ; Hedden, Natalie","As California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) continues to develop institutional capacity to improve sustainability within the contexts of the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), the university mission, and strategic objectives identified by the California State University (CSU), student activism has played a critical role in establishing the groundwork for current efforts. Despite progress towards an overarching goal of integrating sustainability into all parts of the institution, near constant turnover within the institution and student-led organizations often leaves uncertainties about institutionalization, with questions often arising about the respective roles of faculty, staff, and students. It is also often unclear whether the sustainability efforts contributed by students acts to empower them or if it serves as an additional burden. In our research, we compare a case-study of our student-led efforts towards the integration of sustainability at Fresno State to a landscape analysis of integrative sustainability efforts findable across websites of all other CSUs. The aim of this paper is to examine the current roles that students are playing in both campus and system-wide sustainability efforts. Case study and landscape analysis results suggest that while students look to their campuses to provide sustainability leadership, youth-led efforts are apparently the most numerous in advancing efforts across the CSU system. This supports more contemporary views of students and the need for asset-mindedness, as well as the idea that educational institutions--who are charged with leading sustainability (i.e., AASHE)--can increase equity and reduce student burdens by recognizing, supporting, and intentionally collaborating with leading student efforts.",Place and Environment ; student leadership ; landscape analysis ; balance ; sustainability ; student ; school life ; Student-Led ; AASHE ; Educational Leadership ; Higher Education ; work ; work life ; Leadership Studies ; Social Justice ; burdened population ; Fresno,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol1/iss1/3
Strategic Energy Master Planning for Carbon Neutrality,"Patterson, Marie","Universities across the United States are generating goals to be more sustainable and carbon neutral. The energy used in existing buildings on campuses amount to a large volume of greenhouse emissions and must be reduced to help achieve neutrality goals. Strategic Energy Master Plans are instrumental to support these goals through the development of recommendations to reduce energy. Calculating the energy use intensity for existing buildings, a main component of a Strategic Energy Master Plan, can help the campus understand where energy is being used the most. With this information the highest energy consuming buildings can be the focus of renovations to improve energy efficiency to reduce emissions. This study evaluated existing building energy use at California State University, Chico and made energy efficiency recommendations on 12 campus buildings. The information was also used to identify where the campus may fall short of their neutrality goals and provided additional recommendations to meet them.",energy efficiency ; existing buildings ; carbon neutral ; emissions ; planning ; sustainability ; Construction Engineering and Management ; Community and Regional Planning ; Operational Research ; Architectural Engineering ; Urban ; Environmental Design ; Energy Systems ; climate ; Historic Preservation and Conservation ; Operations and Supply Chain Management ; Construction Engineering ; Real Estate,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol1/iss1/8

A Closer Look at CSR Practices in Sustainable Fashion A Guideline for Apparel Brands,"Deogracias, Elline ; Tung, Tracie ; Zappia, Natale","While it might be greenwashing that impedes consumers' eco-consumption, the researchers posit that this gap is also due to fashion brands’ weak CSR communication and inconsistent understanding of CSR activities. This study aims to 1) determine the ease with which consumers can navigate sustainable fashion brand websites to find corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities, and 2) construct a framework that clearly identifies CSR activities, CSR dimensions, and the business operation stages at which they occur. Website content analyses were conducted on 27 sustainable fashion brands in the United States to investigate their CSR activities. A framework was proposed to better understand current CSR activities and guide the future development through literature reviews and definition analyses (CSR definitions in the past 40 years). This study seeks to better understand the effectiveness of CSR presentation on brand websites, to create consistency among CSR activities, and to provide consumers, scholars, and market practitioners with a tool to implement and identify CSR activities.",sustainable fashion ; Sales and Merchandising ; Sustainability ; apparel ; CSR ; web communication ; fast fashion ; Business and Corporate Communications ; Other Business ; Fashion Business ; Marketing ; corporate social responsibility,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol1/iss1/4

Exploring the Use of Trauma Informed Practices in Campus as Lab Programs Learnings from a Workshop Series,"Haas, Laurelin ; Haddock, Rachelle L ; Fullerton, Joe","With the intersectional challenges of the climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, and mental health challenges in various forms, empowerment can hold a significant key to mitigating and preventing traumatic experiences at post-secondary institutions. Campus as Lab (CaL) is a growing trend in higher education whereby students, faculty, and staff use experiential learning and applied research projects to advance sustainability on their campuses. It is a unique, empowering learning methodology that can synergistically benefit academic and operational sustainability efforts at post-secondary institutions. In July 2021, a group of professionals who support or lead CaL initiatives gathered to participate in four Summer Series webinars to explore the use of trauma informed practices in CaL programs. This paper provides a high-level overview of the Summer Series webinar structure and explores how participants identified opportunities to use a trauma informed framework for future CaL initiatives. Because of the Summer Series webinars, we believe there is a need for greater familiarity of trauma informed practices on campuses and amongst sustainability staff. Future research could explore the broader application of trauma informed approaches in the various fields of sustainability within post-secondary institutions.",project-based learning ; climate anxiety ; Health and Medical Sciences ; eco-anxiety ; sustainability professionals ; Other Education ; post-secondary education ; Anthropocene ; experiential learning ; Higher Education ; climate crisis ; professional development,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol2/iss1/2
Post Wildfire Vegetation Response to the Wildland-Urban Interface A Case Study of the Station Fire,"De Guzman, Angelo C ; Bista, Raju ; Chhetri, Parveen K","In the past, wildfires served as a method for mother nature to promote biodiversity and to help maintain a functioning ecosystem. However, climate change alters the fire regime, significantly impacting vegetation recovery. Human disturbances and increased land use and land cover heighten vegetation disruption and abundance after a fire. Wildland-urban interface (WUI) – the region where the vegetation intermingles with the roads, houses, and human-made structures – threatens vegetation and the human population. Overall vegetation recovery after the Station Fire of 2009 spread through the San Gabriel Mountains, Los Angeles County was observed using Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Burn Ratio (nDBR) spectral indices. In addition, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) images were used to measure aboveground biomass (AGB). The study analyzed vegetation biomass recovery by comparing human disturbances and the level of fire severity within the Station Fire perimeter. Low and moderate fire severity were compared in detail against WUI and non-WUI regions by quantifying the amount of biomass in the specified regions. Linear regression model results showed vegetation recovery rates were slower in WUI regions than in non-WUI regions despite having similar regeneration patterns while AGB rebound was similar across both region categories.",Environmental Monitoring ; Sustainability ; Wildland-urban interface ; wildfire ; LiDAR ; biomass ; Forestry ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Remote Sensing ; vegetation ; and Rangeland Management ; Fire ; recovery,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol2/iss1/6
Understanding Consumers’ Motivations and Product Preferences for Deconsumption,"Mishra, Anubha, Dr. ; Borin, Norm ; Lindsey-Mullikin, Joan ; Krishnan, Ram","The modern era features dramatic changes in consumer attitudes and behaviors related to consumption; this article investigates the motivations and product preferences of consumers who alter their consumption habits to obtain products that cause less damage or use fewer resources. The authors offer an empirical definition of such deconsumption and compare it with other terms used in prior literature to refer to resource-restricted purchases; they also propose consumer-oriented measures of deconsumption motivations and product preferences. The results reveal ten motivation factors that help explain why people choose to deconsume. Regression analysis further shows that product choice varies across these motives. Thus, businesses, public policy makers, and non-profit organizations can modify their communication and product strategies, for both green and conventional products and services, to appeal to different subgroups of consumers that deconsume for distinct reasons.",green marketing ; sustainability ; anti-consumption ; Marketing ; Environmental Studies ; product ; consumption,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol2/iss1/4
Energy and Climate Change Issues Around CSUDH,"Perez, Alex E ; Jones, Tara B ; Bista, Raju ; Chhetri, Parveen K","Climate change is posing significant challenges to California’s energy sector. Extreme weather events (heat and cold) may pressure existing infrastructure. Many studies have indicated that extreme climate events would impact the energy system by affecting peak electricity demand. However, very few studies have been conducted to understand how disadvantaged communities (DACs) will be impacted. Because of unequal access to energy infrastructure (electricity generation and battery storage), DACs are more vulnerable to power outages due to the rising number of significant weather events caused by climate change. To address the issue of how DACs are disproportionately affected by climate change-related energy issues, we used DACs, infrastructure, and climate data. We identified the most vulnerable communities associated with climate change-related energy issues in areas around California State University Dominguez Hills (CSUDH). This study’s findings will support building the resilience of energy infrastructure to climate change and minimize the energy burden on DACs.",disadvantaged communities (DACs) ; energy burden ; Sustainability ; grid infrastructure ; energy ; Environmental Indicators and Impact Assessment ; Geographic Information Sciences ; Gas ; Oil ; Environmental Studies ; and Energy ; climate change,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol2/iss1/5
Development of Carbon Emission Assessment Tool Towards Promoting Sustainability in Cal State LA,"Khodayari, Arezoo ; Puvvada, Soumya ; Scott, Jamaie M ; Rotta, Chandra Mouli ; Chadalawada, Geeth Sekhar ; Afshar, Jivar ; Linares, Carlos D ; Haydel, Brad","The great demand for the burning of fossil fuels has greatly increased greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere. An increase in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases produces a positive climate forcing or warming effect [EPA, Climate Change Indicators]. Therefore, mitigation of GHG concentrations is important to prevent long-term impacts on the environment. On April 4, 2016, California State University, Los Angeles signed the most comprehensive of Second Nature’s three Climate Leadership Commitments, the Climate Commitment. Following this commitment, California State University, Los Angeles, set the ambitious goal of operational carbon neutrality by the year 2040. To assist California State University, Los Angeles in moving effectively toward this goal, we developed an energy dashboard that can bring access, awareness, and education to campus about campus carbon footprint and promote energy-efficient behaviors. The developed energy dashboard is an interactive web application that works based on an energy model that is composed of various energy-consuming and GHG producing units such as Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC), Heated Potable Water (HPW), Electricity, and Campus-Related Commutes. This energy dashboard enables individuals to analyze the campus’s energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our research showed that campus-related commute was the first largest contributor to Cal State LA’s carbon footprint in 2018 and accounted for 71.5% of carbon emissions. Electricity and heated potable water accounted for 20%, and 8.5% of the total campus carbon emissions, respectively.

A Framework for Creating Virtual Reality Models for More Effective Coastal Flood Risk Communication,"Korani, Tina ; Martinez, Alexandrea","Coastal cities are exposed to increasing risks of flooding from sea-level rise. Climate change is expected to double the frequency of coastal flooding within the next decade, and some areas could experience floods of a magnitude 100 times higher than currently (Vitousek et al., 2017). People living in at-risk areas often ignore the impact of climate change on flood intensity and frequency. Immersive visual storytelling techniques proved promising and powerful tools to engage with and raise awareness of flood hazards. Here, we are introducing a framework to use Virtual Reality (VR) to reach better people living in coastal cities and help them understand the impact of climate change on their community. We developed a virtual experience in which people can be immersed in a coastal flood and experience its intensity. We used a combination of UAV imagery and digital photogrammetric techniques to create a virtual environment in which people can recognize real locations in their neighborhood and used GIS flood data to apply a water texture in Unity3D to create the flood levels.",Communications ; communication ; Educational Technology ; Environmental Education ; Environmental Studies ; Virtual reality ; photogrammetry ; Mass Communication ; Communication Technology and New Media ; climate change ; flood,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol3/iss1/2
Altering Attitudes on Climate Change Testing the Effect of Time Orientation and Motivation Framing,"Clark, Kylie ; Adams, Aubrie","Climate change has become a defining issue of the 21st century. According to a Pew Research (2020) survey, for the first time in its two-decade history, a majority of Americans now believe that dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the President and Congress, which is a 14% rise from four years prior. Nonetheless, this rise is accompanied by a deep partisan divide amongst citizens of the United States (U.S.) and Republicans are far less likely to consider climate change a top public priority with a roughly 50% partisan gap on the issue (Popovich, 2020). Thus, this partisan gap raises an important question: what are the effects of political orientation, time orientation, and motivation orientation on climate change attitudes and behavioral intention? The goal of this research is to examine this question by testing the influence of these factors on eight outcome variables.",Communications ; attitudes ; Climate change ; political orientation ; Mass Communication ; Social Influence and Political Communication ; Communication Technology and New Media ; Social Media ; framing,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol3/iss1/1

Ayse ; Pacheco, Vanessa ; Chowdhury, Ismael ; Barandas, Sofia","This research examines factors that control pH in Humboldt Bay – a shallow, tidally-driven estuary in northern California (USA) that supports shellfisheries which are economically important to the state. Time-series data from hydrographic sensors at two Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CenCOOS) stations, as well as multiple 2021 undergraduate cruises, were used to understand the role of tides, biological productivity and carbonate dissolution in controlling pH on various timescales. Differences in pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and temperature between an in-bay sensor and a coastal sensor indicate that the tidal flux exerts a long term, seasonal control on pH, but biological productivity substantially modifies carbon and oxygen thereby controlling pH on daily and weekly timescales. Sediment samples were also collected from the bay in 2021 to study carbonate dissolution. Sediments were incubated for three days in both stirred and unstirred conditions (to mimic tidal mixing and no tidal mixing respectively) and DO, pH and alkalinity were monitored. For all stirred incubations, large increases in pH and alkalinity suggested considerable carbonate sediment dissolution. When scaled to the bay’s in-situ suspended sediment concentrations, carbonate dissolution may exert a supplementary control on pH at similar time scales as biological productivity, but the magnitude of its effect is less.",carbonates ; Oceanography ; eelgrass ; Chemical Oceanography ; ocean acidification ; Physical Oceanography ; sediments ; Biologocial Oceanography ; tidal mixing ; Humboldt Bay ; pH ; Geological Oceanography,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol3/iss1/4

To get an approximation of MP concentration, both water and sediment samples were taken at five different stations, twice during one tidal cycle. Sampling was conducted during two different cruises, on the 19th and 21st of September 2020. The samples were processed in the lab using a density separation procedure and filtration. MP concentrations in the different samples were determined using an average optical microscopy count. Comparison of the water column MP concentrations during ebb and flood tides shows higher concentrations during flood tide, 49.0 particles/L ± 32.37 (flood) vs 34.4 particles/L ± 16.32 (ebb), indicating that MPs are brought into Humboldt Bay from the ocean. The comparison of the MP concentrations during lower energy and higher energy conditions indicates that concentrations in the water column were elevated when there was greater tidal kinetic energy, approximated by the covariance of the measured velocity in North Bay Channel. This result was assumed to be caused by the strong tidal currents stirring up both sediments and the settled MPs into the water column. Due to lower tidal kinetic energy on the sediment sampling cruise day, we could not confirm that assumption. Water samples indicated that MPs are heterogeneously distributed in the bay, with higher concentrations found near the Entrance Channel and lower concentrations found further north in the bay. Sediment samples also indicate a heterogeneous distribution of MPs in the bay, with the lowest concentrations near the Entrance Channel, 15 particles/kg, where high tidal currents inhibit settling of particles.",Oceanography ; oceanography ; microplastics ; physical oceanography ; Biological Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol3/iss1/3

This study used a survey administered from December 2020 to January 2021, the end of the second semester of remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic at Chico State, to assess employee wellness needs. The quantitative results from a total of 324 survey responses showed that two dimensions of wellbeing that employees rated highest in terms of what their organization engages or promotes were intellectual and relational wellbeing. The two dimensions rated lowest were physical and spiritual wellbeing. The qualitative results showed specific areas of concern that emerged from the survey, including a need for increased healthy lifestyle behaviors, a balanced workload, and a desire for a sense of value within the institution.

Quantifying Human Population Benefits from Renewable Energy Plants,"McNevin, Jacob D ; Miers, James W","The implementation of renewable energy is widely recognized for its positive impact on human health and well-being. We propose methods to quantify these benefits by estimating each renewable energy plant’s impact on human mortality and climate-induced displacement. Utilizing established models (DICE, Mortality Cost of Carbon, and methods from Lenton and Xu), we calculate the avoided heat-related mortalities and loss of human climate niche attributable to avoided CO₂ emissions from renewable energy. Applying this methodology to three California clean energy projects—Morro Bay Wind Energy Area (WEA), Morro Bay Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), and American Energy Services (AES) Bellefield Solar Farm—demonstrates the significant potential of renewable energy to improve human well-being. The Morro Bay WEA is estimated to prevent over 18,000 global deaths and alleviate the need to relocate over 400,000 people due to extreme heat.

Behavioral Change Towards Meat Consumption To Address Climate Change,"Giraldo, Mario A ; Aljersh, Jad","Although there is consensus in the need to address the causes of climate change, very little attention has been done to implementing large scale strategies to produce behavioral change in the community to reduce greenhouse emissions. We conducted a study among college students, to evaluate their behavioral change towards a plant based diet after reflecting in the environmental effect in greenhouse emissions of animal protein consumption. During a two weeks’ period participants were required to keep a diary of the food items and meat servings they consumed, and to calculate the carbon footprint of their diet. On the second week of the experiment participants were required to introduce for at least one meal a fully vegetarian option and calculate carbon footprint again. Participants were asked to reflect on the carbon impact of the alternative vegetarian option, recording their own personal feelings, believes and attitudes towards a meatless diet. Quantitative and qualitative analysis were used to assess participants’ consumption habits and their personal reactions towards a plant based diet. The results showed participants were surprised with their own carbon footprint from meat consumption, eagerness to decrease meat consumption during the second week, and a positive experience with the low-meat diet they consumed during the second week. The study concludes that in general meatless diets were accepted by the majority of participants after increasing their awareness of the environmental impacts that animal based protein has on global warming.",Sustainable Food Systems ; Geography ; carbon footprint; meat consumption; CO2 emissions; global warming; behavioral change ; Climate Justice and Resilience,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol4/iss1/5

Acting on Behalf of an Endangered Species - A Student-led Initiative to Protect the San Joaquin Kit Fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) on the CSUB Campus,"Lauer, Antje ; Alame, Sarah ; Beck, Brittney ; Hall, Lucas","California State University Bakersfield (CSUB) is the only campus in the U.S. that has supported an endangered canine species on its campus grounds for many decades. Deprived of its prime habitat, open grassland, the San Joaquin kit fox (SJKF) (Vulpes macrotis mutica) was able to adapt to urban areas in the San Joaquin Valley of California. The presence of an endangered species on campus grounds comes with responsibilities and requires knowledge of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). In the spring of 2023, students and faculty observed several violations of the ESA by CSUB Facilities Management due to ground disturbance and rodent control measures that harmed the SJKF population, which were raising pups during that time. This was confirmed by researchers belonging to the Endangered Species Recovery Program (ESRP) who were tracking collared foxes on campus. To prevent further violations of the ESA, the CSUB Associated Students, Inc. (ASI) and the student-led CSUB organization, Students for Sustainability, supported by faculty, repeatedly called on the higher administration to show leadership and to respond to these repeated violations in a timely manner. A petition to protect the SJKF on campus was started and the CSUB Kit Fox Society was born. Only after the violations were reported to the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, 10 weeks after the students first met with the provost, the administration recognized the seriousness of the situation and was open to meetings and discussions with students and faculty. CSUB hopes to become a better steward of endangered species on campus and all species who call our shared environment home. The goal for our campus is to become a living lab where students can learn about biodiversity and become inspired to protect it. In this paper, we describe how we identified violations against the ESA at CSUB, spoke up about environmental injustice, and suggested solutions to the administration. While efforts to monitor and protect the SJKF are still ongoing at CSUB, the hope is for our experience to serve as a warning to other campuses regarding the risks of being inattentive to biodiversity on campus and a call for shared governance by students, faculty, and administration to create research-based, transparent policies, practices, and procedures to protect biodiversity.",Wildlife Management and Conservation ; San Joaquin Kit Fox ; Sustainable Conservation ; California Ground Squirrel ; Endangered Species Act ; Kit Fox Society ; Zoology ; Environmental Management and Protection ; Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol4/iss1/1
Analyzing Waste Flows on a College Campus A Waste Characterization Study at California State University San Marcos,"Hansen, Caitlin R","The foundation of sustainability and improving a system is to first understand its components. Waste management is a vastly complex issue, with an increasing number of material types and ever-changing regulations. Sorting and processing refuse is a fundamental aspect of society that often goes unmeasured due to its complex nature. To grow sustainably, it is imperative to classify, categorize, and quantify the waste we create daily. This study builds upon existing on-campus large-scale waste audits conducted by EDCO, the California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) waste hauler, which quantifies the amount and types of waste removed from campus. However, this study differs from those efforts in that it focuses on specific waste streams, excluding campus housing, to determine the percentage of trash that could be diverted from EDCO’s landfills to either recycling or composing programs and is specifically tailored to the CSUSM sustainability goals. Only outside landfill receptacle bins were utilized in the study, and their contents were sorted on variable days, Monday through Friday, for three months, totaling 28 days. Refuse was categorized into nine groups according to EDCO’s recycling and composting regulations and then weighed.

Evaluating the Pollutant Permeation Index (PPI) for Regional Air Quality Assessment A Study of Los Angeles and California Regions,"Afshar, Jivar ; Khodayari, Arezoo ; Taghvaee, Sina","Air pollution poses significant challenges by affecting public health, increasing the prevalence of air quality-related diseases, and contributing to climate change. Federal, state, and local governments are implementing various regulations and policies to mitigate these effects. However, assessing the effectiveness of localized air pollution regulations remains complex, often relying on extensive data collection methods, such as emission inventories. This paper introduces the Pollution Permeation Index (PPI), a novel method that simplifies the evaluation of health burdens resulting from pollutant migration between neighboring regions. The PPI method employs straightforward calculations to quantify how pollutants, including Ozone (O₃), fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), and Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM), transfer between areas, identifying which regions act as sources (donors) and which as recipients (receptors) of pollutants. To assess the efficacy of the PPI, this study analyzed various target areas within the City of Los Angeles, as well as a broader examination of Los Angeles County and its surrounding areas. Correlation analyses between the Air Quality Index (AQI) and PPI were conducted to understand the impact of pollutant permeation on air quality. The findings demonstrate that the PPI is an effective and efficient tool for quantifying pollutant levels across different regions, offering valuable insights to policymakers for improving and refining air pollution regulations.",: Pollutant Permeation Index; Ozone; Fine Particulate Matter; Air Quality Index; Los Angeles County ; Climate Justice and Resilience ; Civil Engineering ; Environmental Management and Protection ; Environmental Resources Engineering,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/sustainability/vol4/iss1/6

Domingo Santos on Vaissade Road; 8. Nicholson on Mad River Road; 9. unknown on west side of Parton Lane.
Ike said that at the end of World War Il, there were 154 dairies on the Arcata bottom and three creameries: United where Greenview Market it located; Golden State between 8th and 9th streets west of railroad; and a cheese plant Nye-Nissen in built west of present Recycling Center. He said that up to wwn, dairying was as good a job as working in the woods or mill. Twenty cows, two horses, a little tractor would net $1,500 a year. The best dairying period was between 1946 and 1953, but not paying much any more. Ike estimated bottom covered about 5,200 acres.

"Lower Prairie Creek Project Redwood National Park ""Forest Owners""","Van Kirk, Susie","""This file addresses forest ownerships, using deeds, patents, and maps in the Humboldt County Recorder’s Office, Eureka Courthouse. Pretty boring to wade through, these records, nonetheless, document how the public domain of northwestern California—the ancient redwood forests—came to be concentrated in the hands of timber companies. ... Land in the Lower Prairie Creek Project area (plus much, much other forest lands) was obtained through fraudulent patents and deed transactions involving David Evans and his associates for transfer to Scottish investors and eventually to “legitimate” timber companies. The end result, of course, is that what once belonged to indigenous people and then the American public, illegally became the property of private timber companies. Ironically, when the public recognized the urgent need to reserve some portion of these magnificent forests in state parks and a national park, it paid dearly to restore these treasures to public ownership and protection.""",Natural Resources Management and Policy ; Indigenous Studies ; Environmental Sciences ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; United States History ; Lower Prairie Creek ; Natural Resources and Conservation ; Redwood National Park ; History ; Humboldt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/svk/32

"To Catch the Rain Inspiring stories of communities coming together to harvest their own rain, and how you can do it too","Grafman, Lonny","If water is life, rainwater is a fountain of life. The purpose of this book is to show how various communities have caught that fountain of life using rainwater catchment systems. This book looks at real, practical, global experiences of rainwater harvesting on individual, financially constrained, and community based levels through academic, mathematical and practical perspectives. This book can be used to learn practical skills, see inspiring examples, and to make math have more meaning. This book is for practitioners, DIYers, community members looking for water solutions, as well as for students and teachers in environmental science, environmental studies, sustainable design, international development, engineering, and mathematics. The book is broken into sections on rainwater catchment in general, types, components, gravity, calculations, implementation stories, useful links, conversions, and problem-sets.

Pass the FAA Drone Pilot Test—Remote Pilot Exam Preparation 2020,"Malloy, Nicolas R","Part 107 is the subdivision of Subchapter F of Chapter 1 of Title 14 that pertains to small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS). To legally fly a small unmanned aircraft for non-hobby, non-recreational use, remote pilots must abide by these regulations. This book is intended to explain the Part 107 regulations in a short and easy to read format. Additionally, this book also covers other areas of knowledge required by the FAA, including airspace and requirements, weather, loading and performance, and operations. Readers also have access to a series of sample test questions. Because the FAA does not provide specific test-questions to the public, the sample questions here are based on the information available through documentation and research.

"Laboratories in Mathematical Experimentation A Bridge to Higher Mathematics, 2nd Edition","Bruce, J.

The approach is hands-on and experimental, an approach that is very much in the spirit of modern pedagogy. The course is typically offered in one semester, at the sophomore (second year) level of college. It requires prior exposure to calculus and provides a transition to the study of higher, abstract mathematics. Most of the laboratories require the use of a computer for experimentation, but the text is written independent of any particular software.

Place Based Learning Community Planning Guide,"Goldenberg, Katlin ; Matthews, Jessica ; Palomera, Raven ; Margell, Steven ; Gorman, Alex ; Sprowles, Amy ; Johnson, Matt","The introduction of Place Based Learning Communities (PBLCs) at HSU in 2015 has become an increasingly discussed topic throughout the university. We use the term “Learning Community” in its strictest sense - a curricular approach to education that intentionally links a cluster of courses around an interdisciplinary theme and enrolls a common cohort of students. The production of higher GPAs and retention and significant achievement gap closure among the HSU PBLC cohorts is undeniable.
All components are comprehensive in the fact that they build a sense of community, belonging, and accountability within the students which serve as factors for higher retention and academic success. Each class, event, study session, field trip, and staff and faculty member are all parts of what make PBLC such a success. There are many components that need to be established and collaborations that need to be formed in order to make student achievement possible. In this manual, you will read what these components and collaborations look like and upon conclusion you will understand what goes into creating a successful Place Based Learning Community.",Higher Education ; Educational Methods,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/reports/1

"Lobstermen, Lobbyists, and Labor Unions Knowledge Gaps and Power in Maine’s Offshore Wind Development","Kashwan, Prakash","Lecture delivered October 14, 2024. Large-scale development of offshore wind (OSW) is a relatively new field with a variety of knowledge gaps about its social and environmental impacts. These knowledge gaps create opportunities for obstructing policy development by entrenched interests. Based on research in Maine and preliminary results of ongoing research in California, Dr. Prakash Kashwan offers lessons for promoting policy development in the presence of competing interests and knowledge gaps. He shows that countering the cynical politics of entrenched opposition demands nimble and adaptive collaborations among actors cutting across the silos of state, society, and markets. He concludes by reflecting on the implications of this research for OSW policy development on the West Coast. Kashwan is an Associate Professor of Environmental Studies at Brandeis University, and the Chair of the Environmental Justice concentration in the Master of Public Policy (MPP) program at the Heller School of Social Policy and Management. A recent article reflecting some of his research findings, “Maine Unions Lead on the Green Energy Transition,” can be read here.

Microhabitat Selection of Pacific Giant Salamander Larvae,"Watling, Rebecca","Pacific giant salamander larvae (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) inhabit headwater streams and are sensitive to heavy sedimentation and stream degradation. I looked at levels of sedimentation within and between plots in a headwater stream, and salamander use of substrate types to determine if they were selecting against sediment. I found that they used sediment proportionately less than it was available and small woody debris proportionately more than it was available. Pacific giants are indicators of stream quality, and can be used to direct management and logging regulations. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1000/thumbnail.jpg",Life Sciences ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1
Snowy Egret Foraging Success in Relation to Tide Levels,"Juarros, Alexander","Energy intake is important for wading birds as it maintains body processes that allow them to survive and reproduce, therefore it is important to study the effects that can potentially affect wading’ ability to forage (Schmidt-Nielsen 1997). Factors that may influence wading birds foraging behavior can be biotic or abiotic, such as tide levels (Maccarone and Parsons 1994, Maccarone and Brzorad 2005). This abiotic variable can affect the strike rate and foraging success of certain wading species, such as the snowy egret (Egretta thula) (Barnhart et al. 1992). To determine if snowy egrets foraging behavior is affected by changing tide levels, 10-15 minute focal observations were conducted in the Arcata Marsh during low, medium, and high tide. After observing 32 individual snowy egrets in the Arcata Marsh, strike rate did not vary between the tide levels, but the foraging success of snowy egrets was higher at lower tides. Potential reasons why strike rate did not vary between the different tide levels could be due to prey abundance and source or the foraging method used by snowy egrets in relation to the tide. These variables could be explored in future studies to see if they vary among tide levels. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1001/thumbnail.jpg",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/3
The Influence of Light Intensity on Black-crowned Night Heron Roost Departure,"Miranda, Melissa A","Black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) are nocturnal wading marsh birds in the family Ardeidae. I studied the departure of black-crowned night herons from their roost in northwestern California, and light intensity, measured in Lux, from September to November 2016. There was a strong, negative correlation between light intensity and roost departure in this species. 976 individuals were observed, in which over 94% did not depart from the roost until ≤ 0.3 Lux. The optimal roost departure light intensity was 0.0 Lux. The first heron left the roost 22 minutes after sunset, on average. Finding that light intensity heavily influences black-crowned night heron roost departure behavior could perhaps propel further more intensive studies to focus on the spectral sensitivity and visual abilities of this species. Management implications include advising developers against constructing light fixtures that give off high intensity near roost sites, to avoid affecting the behavior of black-crowned night heron roost departure flight patterns. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1002/thumbnail.jpg",Other Animal Sciences ; Ornithology ; Zoology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/2

Pacific Wren Singing Behavior in Relation to Temperature,"Gorman, Riley L","The effects of climate change on bird behavior have not been well researched (Moller 2010). Song production is believed to be energetically expensive (Johnson and Rashotte 2002) and a behavior that is mutually exclusive of foraging and resting (Thomas 1998). I studied how ambient and overnight temperatures affected the average song length, number of songs and total time spent singing in Pacific wrens in the Arcata Community Forest in Humboldt, California. Data was collected in 5 minute listening surveys with a sound recorder and later analyzed. I found that the average song length of Pacific wrens significantly increased after warmer nights. However, the number of days from the start of the surveys and overnight temperatures were also strongly correlated. It is possible that an increase in song length is either due to the onset of the breeding season or an increase in temperature or both. Knowing how temperature affects Pacific wrens could help researchers adjust detection probabilities for surveys (Slagsvold 1977) and evaluate how changes in forest structure and microclimates (Chen 1999) might affect their behavior. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1004/thumbnail.jpg",Ornithology ; Behavior and Ethology ; Zoology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/5
"If You Build It, They Will Come Nest Site Selection of Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) in West-central Idaho","Meisman, Elizabeth ; Styhl, Tyrell ; Krouse, Bryan ; Bechard, Marc ; Miller, Robert ; Johnson, Matthew ; Perkins, Dusty","Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) are fish-eating, top predators of aquatic ecosystems that serve as useful sentinel species for monitoring environmental contaminants and ecosystem health. Ospreys further appear highly adaptable to human-dominated landscapes and readily nest on artificial structures that occur within an array of land use and land cover (LULC) types and human settlement regimes. In Long Valley Idaho, the abundance of breeding Ospreys has declined slightly since the late 1970’s while the distribution of nests and nest substrate use has changed dramatically. To evaluate if changes in nest structure availability and use, coupled with increasing anthropogenic landscape conversion, could be changing osprey nest site selection, we evaluated relationships among nest site characteristics. We used multivariate generalized linear models with model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of LULC composition and nest site characteristics associated with nest occupancy. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1005/thumbnail.jpg",Ornithology ; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/6
Using Life History Traits to Understand Human Perception of Visual and Vocal Attractiveness of Songbird Species,"Wong, Jane M.","Sexual dimorphism occurs in many songbird species, where plumage ornamentation and song are greatly exaggerated. Studies have shown that life history traits like nest shape and ecological environments may influence sexual selection in birds. In this study, I examined whether or not certain life history traits affect human perception of attractiveness in birds. Using previous scores of human perceived attractiveness of song and plumage, I ran a candidate model set of linear regression models and ranked them based on the Akaike information criterion correlation (AICc) scores of life history covariates to determine the top model of the candidate set. Using the top model, I predicted scores for 15 new songbird species. I found a negative correlation between visual and vocal attractiveness when comparing the top 5 song covariates. A weak positive correlation was found when only comparing the top 5 plumage covariates and the different top 5 song and plumage covariates. This study may further inform conservation biologists about human perception of birds to raise awareness of avian conservation in order to protect unique songbird species. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1006/thumbnail.jpg",Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/7
Compensatory Grass Growth Response in a Simulated Goose Grazing and Fecal Fertilization Experiment,"Hecocks, Sarah J","To quantify the effects that wintering Aleutian cackling geese have on agricultural grasslands in Humboldt County, I conducted an experimental study to determine the levels at which grazing and fecal fertilization can both benefit and inhibit the regrowth of ryegrass, a preferred forage species. Results indicated that growth rates are highest at low to moderate levels of grazing, high levels of fertilization, and moderate levels of both grazing and fertilization (1.83g/day). The control, receiving no treatment, yielded the second lowest growth rate (0.78 g/day). I concluded that the combination of herbivory and fecal fertilization at a moderate level is important for plant stimulation, and suggests that a mutualistic relationship exists between Aleutian geese and pasture grass. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1007/thumbnail.jpg",Agricultural Science ; Ornithology ; Poultry or Avian Science ; Agronomy and Crop Sciences ; Biodiversity ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/8
California Vole Runway Maintenance Is Not A Valid Indicator of Population Size,"Shofstall, Krista J",California voles (Microtus californicus) are a major prey resource for many raptor species. Determining vole population size has traditionally been done with mark-recapture using Sherman traps but this method is very invasive. Several less invasive techniques have been tried but proven to be unreliable. We tried to use toothpick obstructions to block runways and use obstruction clean up rates to determine population size. These obstructions proved to be unreliable due to the voles going around the obstructions and the rate of obstruction removal was variable. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1008/thumbnail.jpg,Social and Behavioral Sciences ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/9
Mist-Net Capture Rates as an Index to Identify Trend in Passerine Abundance and Productivity,"Dante, Shane Bruce","To better understand what is affecting bird populations, it is necessary to examine abundance of bird species in specific locations, and to make comparisons that may reveal possible ecological factors for observed trends.  It may be helpful to compare population trends of Neotropical migrants and permanent residents, and species in different guilds. I examined a 23 year data set (1993 to 2015) from a constant effort mist-netting project conducted on the North Coast of California, using Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) protocol. I analyzed capture rates per net hour as an index of abundance for 3 of the most commonly captured migratory song bird species and a common resident; namely, the Swainson’s Thrush, Wilson’s Warbler, Orange-crowned Warbler, and Song Sparrow. Using my index of abundance I found a decreasing trend in abundance for Swainson’s Thrush adults and hatch years (young known to have hatched in the calendar year), as well as for hatch year Song Sparrows. In addition, productivity remained steady throughout the study. Lastly, Swainson’s Thrush adult abundance in one year (t+1) was positively correlated with hatch year abundance the previous year (t). Wilson’s Warblers exhibited a negative correlation between adult abundance (t+1) and hatch year abundance (t). Analyses of data from the Wright Wildlife Refuge has not been published, spurring the need for my examination of passerine abundance and productivity in a relatively unchanged forest community. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1009/thumbnail.jpg",Population Biology,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/10
"Food Habits of Barn Owls (Tyto alba) in Humboldt County, California","Lopez, Katrina","I used pellet analysis, a non-invasive method for studying the diet of raptorial birds, to quantify the diets of Barn Owls (Tyto alba) in a region where their diet has not previously been studied; Humboldt County, California. I identified 1113 prey items from 430 pellets collected from February to April 2018. I found that owl diets were primarily composed of small rodents, particularly the California vole (Microtus californicus), which also made up most of the relative biomass of prey consumed (62.89%). I also estimated the food niche breadth of Barn Owls and concluded that while they have a specialist diet (FNB st = 0.07), they also exhibit an opportunistic feeding strategy in their ability to take a range of prey species. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1010/thumbnail.jpg",Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/11
"Do Depth, Substrate, and Orientation Affect PIT-tag Detection Probability?","Roos, Axel","I addressed how detection probability of Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags is affected by depth, orientation of tags, and type of substrate. Seabirds consume wild salmonids that are implanted with PIT tags (Evans et al. 2012). These tags are often deposited at the seabirds’ colonies, providing a means to study their ecology (Evans et al. 2012). I tested if tags were detected in duff, sand, or no substrate- at different depths and with tags in the vertical, horizontal, or diagonal orientation. I also extensively scanned a plot at a multi-species heronry to get an estimated total of PIT tags, then rescanned the plot 10 times to determine how many tags were detected each trial. Detection probability decreased with depth, increased in the vertical orientation, did not differ between sand and duff substrates, and did not differ between diagonal and horizontal orientations. At the heronry site, there was a detection probability of 0.83 across the trials, which ranged from 0.74-1.00 detected. These findings provide beneficial information on what variables affect detection for future terrestrial PIT tag studies. ; https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/1011/thumbnail.jpg",Natural Resources and Conservation ; Statistical Models ; Animal Sciences,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wildlife_posters/12
Wiyot History Papers,"Rohde, Jerry","""The Wiyot History Papers are an astonishing and deeply moving set of documents. They contain the only known statements that were both given by and recorded by Indians, probably dictated in the Wiyot language in the early 1920s by several Wiyot elders and translated and transcribed by a younger Wiyot, Warren Brenard. The accounts give great insight into what actually happened to the Humboldt County Indians in the mid-19th century and are testimony to the courage and endurance of a people who for years were under merciless attack.""--Introduction",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/wiyot_history_papers/1

La primera parte, titulada “Viajes y encuentros con Alexander von Humboldt”, incluye los artículos centrados específicamente en diferentes aspectos del legado de Alexander von Humboldt e incluye los artículos de los conferencistas magistrales. Recomendaría el último artículo de esta sección, para aquéllos que deseen profundizar más en la obra de von Humboldt, el cual explica el contenido y las funciones de los Escritos Completos de Alexander von Humboldt como una edición digital de acceso abierto. La segunda parte, titulada “Viajes, Historia, Cine, Ciencia y Literatura”, incluye artículos relacionados con otros aspectos del Congreso. Como lo expresa el título de la sección, hay una diversidad de temas, muchos relacionados con los viajes y la literatura del mundo de habla hispana.

Los méritos de Alexander von Humboldt para la climatología mundial y para la forestación,"Holl, Frank","Alexander von Humboldt fue uno de los climatólogos más destacados del siglo XIX. El presente artículo trata sobre sus estudios climáticos y muestra el impacto que estos tuvieron en muchos países del mundo. La primera publicación fundamental sobre los efectos climáticos de los bosques la realizó Humboldt en 1809 en su Ensayo político sobre Nueva España. Numerosas medidas de forestación se iniciaron en el siglo XIX gracias a sus estudios. Pero Humboldt detectó algo más: fue el primero que habló de “grandes masas de vapor y gas en los centros de la industria” que afectan el clima. Sin embargo, él no podía prever las amenazas de un cambio climático antropogénico tal y como lo afrontamos hoy. Pero especialmente en México y Estados Unidos, sus estudios sirvieron de referencia clave para iniciativas de forestación. Sus hallazgos con referencia al impacto climático de los bosques, no obstante, cayeron en el olvido en el siglo XX. El hilo roto de la recepción de las investigaciones de Humboldt sobre el clima se reanudó con el movimiento ecologista en la década de 1970 y Alexander von Humboldt fue reevaluado como climatólogo y primer ecólogo moderno.",Technology ; sostenibilidad ; History of Science ; ecología ; and Medicine ; forestación ; cambio climático ; Humboldt,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/1

Durante su vida, 250 de sus artículos aparecieron en inglés y 40 en ruso. Las experiencias de Humboldt en Estados Unidos y en Rusia fueron contradictorias. En Estados Unidos encontró condiciones favorables para la comunicación de sus ideas políticas. En Rusia, viajó en condiciones difíciles de vigilancia y censura. Así, en el mundo inglés y en el mundo ruso, Humboldt se muestra desde dos lados opuestos: como un intelectual público y un científico comprometido.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/2
Alexander von Humboldt en España. Los antecedentes necesarios del viaje americano.,"Puig-Samper, Miguel Angel","Uno de los aspectos más desconocidos del viaje americano de Alejandro de Humboldt es el de su paso por España, sobre todo su trabajo científico, sus contactos y los medios de preparación de la exploración del Nuevo Mundo en compañía del botánico y médico francés Aimé Bonpland. Humboldt tenía varios motivos para tomar la decisión de viajar a España, aunque el fundamental fue el fracaso de sus planes anteriores para viajar a otros lugares del mundo. Necesitaba el permiso del rey Carlos IV para investigar en las regiones que le interesaban. Conseguir este permiso no era un asunto fácil, ya que el gobierno de España había mantenido la política de no dejar entrar extranjeros en sus colonias, al menos de una manera tan privada. En parte debido a la capacidad diplomática que tenía Humboldt, pero en mayor medida por los contactos indicados que mantuvo con personas influyentes, fue lo que hizo posible que Humboldt consiguiera el permiso necesario para la realización de su proyecto americano. nivelaciones barométricas y se ofrece el perfil topográfico peninsular. De alguna manera el viaje por España se puede considerar como el viaje preparatorio, planeado para el proyecto americano, ya que realizaron el tipo de investigaciones con las que querían iniciar sus labores también en América. Esto tiene que ser considerado como una hazaña científica porque este tipo de investigaciones apenas se podían apoyar en trabajos hechos anteriormente. Finalmente, hay que reconocer la aportación notable que hicieron Humboldt y Bonpland para la investigación naturalista de España.",Technology ; History of Science ; Latin American History ; European History ; and Medicine ; Intellectual History,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/3
Encuentro feliz Benjamin Vicuna Mackenna y Alexander von Humboldt,"Brintrup Hertling, Lilianet","Benjamín Vicuña MacKenna y Alexander von Humboldt. El intenso deseo del joven chileno de 24 años, Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna (1831-1886), escritor, periodista, historiador, político y viajero, de encontrarse con el famoso científico prusiano Alexander von Humboldt en Berlín en 1855, lo lleva a describir con singular detalle este encuentro breve y cruzado. La superioridad del científico europeo es expresada en un tono de sólida admiración. Admiración que no era mutua, porque von Humboldt no podía admirar a quien aún no había ni estudiado ni escrito, y el científico prusiano ya había viajado y realizado su tarea en el Continente Americano. Un viajero tan singular como Vicuña Mackenna se las arregla para que en su narración quede testimonio de cómo un chileno puede llegar a tener, no sólo un encuentro, sino una conversación tȇte-a-tȇte con dicho científico altamente célebre. La inminencia del encuentro mismo, eclipsa el total aburrimiento que Vicuña Mackenna experimentaba en Berlín. Dejar por escrito ese ‘momento huidizo del encuentro único’ era importante, pues era el modo de quedar registrado para siempre en la historia de los viajes y de las ciencias en Chile y de su desempeño posterior como figura pública; y de paso les recordaba a sus lectores, que él era parte de una “filiación de ruta cultural y científica” y que no era un improvisado. El encuentro ‘feliz’ con von Humboldt hace que Vicuña Mackenna llegue a Berlín siendo uno y regrese a Chile siendo otro, ya educado y formado.",Viajes ; Alexander von Humboldt ; Literatura ; Benjamin Vicuna Mackenna ; Siglo XIX ; Spanish Literature,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/4

Paisaje de Cataluña y Valencia. Polimatía y epistemología en el sello epistolar de Alexander von Humboldt en concordancia con las observaciones de Antonio José Cavanilles,"Garcia, Martha","Epistolary activity dates to Ancient Greece in affinity with the Roman tradition in which the missive was the most efficient means of communication at a distance. An erudite knowledge of the subject was required since the content would be recorded in posterity. Polymathy and epistemology were therefore required in daily practice of writing encyclicals from the society of Medieval era up to the pinnacle of the epistolary genre during Humanism. The letter, therefore, implied the fact that the writer was out from the territory of the point of departure and the recipient of the correspondence was distant. This exegesis focuses on the textual legacy of Alexander von Humboldt, who, given his wisdom as a naturalist and humanist, sketches in the letter sent to Kurl Ludwig Willdenow as a literary portrait the vivid illustration of the ecological contour of the Catalan and Valencian regions. The narrative images printed also on Cavanilles’ observations and on Humboldt’s cartography are in dialogue—in the form of a travel chronicle— with the pictorial works La sierra de las Agujas and Paisaje de Cataluña, respectively. The methodology applied consists of the analysis of the textuality of Cavanilles’ observations and Humboldt’s epistolary that focuses on the protagonism of nature in the historical distance of time and space. To this end, careful attention has been dedicated to the rhetorical premise of narratio inscribed in Humboldt’s letter, which converges graphically with the landscape of Catalonia and Valencia due to his travels made on the European continent and throughout Spain.",Fine Arts ; Modern Languages ; Narratio ; Rhetoric and Composition ; Humboldt ; Rhetoric ; Retórica ; Epistemología ; Textualidad ; Viajes (10 words) ; Art Practice ; Classics ; Arts and Humanities ; Arte ; Cavanilles ; Spanish and Portuguese Language and Literature ; España ; Polimatía ; Reading and Language ; Spanish Literature,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/one/6
Los mapas gráficos multi-dato de los viajes científicos de Humboldt como precedente  de los modernos sistemas socio-ecológicos,"Muñiz Martínez, Norberto","Este artículo analiza el papel visionario de Alexander von Humboldt como científico geógrafo que sentó las bases de la integración de los análisis geográfico-ecológicos y los humano-sociales. Humboldt fue precursor de la interdisciplinaridad científica, integrando la observación científico-empírica basada en la recogida de datos, con un subjetivismo compatible con el sentimiento hacia la naturaleza y los seres vivos. Humboldt aunó metodológicamente ese enfoque dual en análisis gráficos que captaban las complejidades derivadas de los sistemas complejos y emergentes, donde el todo en su conjunto es más que la suma de partes fragmentadas. Su visión combinaba análisis de ámbito local y global, sentando los precedentes teórico-conceptuales de los sistemas socio-ecológicos holísticamente considerados. Inspirándose en el gráfico bio-geográfico del NaturGemälde de Humboldt y su interpretación multivariable, este trabajo ofrece una revisión de mapas conceptuales de sistemas socio-naturales.

Alexander Von Humboldt rescate patrimonial y escritos para una memoria de justicia social latinoamericana,"Ilarregui, Gladys","Un códice, una estatuilla en piedra, un dibujo estelar en un papel plegado, el ocre y el rojo ladrillo decorando figuras extrañas.

Desde la modernidad que Byung- Chul-Han describe como el momento de las “no-cosas”, cuando las cosas que estabilizaban la vida humana y le daban continuidad pierden su efecto sobrecargadas de información y sin nostalgias, el interés de Alexander von Humboldt por los documentos mesoamericanos, nos da una idea de su infatigable reconocimiento por las culturas prehispánicas y el esfuerzo por decodificar sus significados. Se sabe que principios del siglo XIX, von Humboldt dio a conocer la existencia del Códice Vaticano A (Codex Vatic. Lat. 3788) conservado en la Biblioteca Apostólica Vaticana, además de su ya conocido aporte con la impresión de las láminas del Códice Dresden.

The Astrobiological figure of Humboldt as pioneer in the rock varnish research,"Jordan-Soria, Jose","From Humboldt is particularly interesting -and little know- his description of mineral coatings on rocks 200 years ago, reported in his book Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent during the years 1799-1804, co-written with Aimé Bonpland, for which is considerate the father of rock coating research. On June 5th 1799 set sail from A Coruña -Spain- to Cumaná -Venezuela- beginning five years of expedition. While they explored the Orinoco River system, in th eriver basin waterfalls, Humboldt observed the presence of dark coating depositions. He ascertained a manganese-rich accretion, reporting similar structures in other places. Nowadays, these types of geochemical coatings are called rock varnish -or desert varnish in arid environments- in scientific literature. Composed by clay minerals -Si, Al- cemented on a bedrock with variable manganese [Mn]-iron[Fe]oxides and trace elements in it smatrix, only has been studied in detail just during the last decades, achieving an accurate chemical and microbiological description. These structures have great geomicroecological interest because (i) it has a high oxidative power, (ii) gather polyextreme conditions, (iii) stressful conditions, (iv) host microorganisms of biotechnological interest and (v) can preserve interesting biomarkers embedded in its matrix. In fact, interesting rock varnish-like structures have been observed in Mars where appreciable amounts of manganese have been detected by Chem-Cam onboard Curiosity rover.

La España de José Martí,"Hernández, Laura A.","Después de sufrir en Cuba una terrible condena a trabajos forzados, acusado de atentar contra la corona española, José Martí consigue que le sea concedido el destierro a España. Llega a Cádiz cuando inicia el año de 1871, y España se encuentra bajo el breve reinado de Amadeo de Saboya, quien ha sustituido a Isabel II después de ser obligada a abdicar, pero que será derrocado en 1873 por un gobierno republicano. Martí dejará España a fines de 1874 para reencontrase con su familia en México, cuando los borbones han recuperado el poder y preparan el ascenso al trono de Alfonso XII. No parece aventurado, entonces, afirmar que Martí vive uno de los momentos más importantes de la historia de España -la patria de sus padres-, donde se formará como universitario y adoptará ideales de la filosofía krausista, que es la base en que se funda la ideología republicana. Y si bien esta efervescencia liberal la comparte Martí con entusiasmo, el hecho de que los liberales no se planteen conceder la independencia a Cuba -temerosos de sucumbir ante unas arcas vacías-, lo obliga a enfrentarse con ellos a través de artículos periodísticos, donde señala con firmeza la incongruencia que representa que una república sea colonialista.

Los primeros viajes decisivos de Fernando Arrabal entre España y Francia,"Tallgren, Viveca","The first journeys of the writer and dramatist Fernando Arrabal between his home country Spain and France were decisive for both his life and his extensive literary production. Arrabal grew up in Franco’s Spain. His father was a Republican lieutenant and was sentenced to imprisonment for life because of his denying to participate in Franco’s rebellion against the democratic Republic. Arrabal’s mother was, however, a supporter of Franco. This political clash between Arrabal’s parents affected him strongly. During his adolescence it became difficult for him to endure the cultural climate in Franco’s Spain. At the age of 22 he hitchhiked to Paris to see Brecht’s Mutter Courage and got fascinated by the liberal atmosphere in Paris. He succeeded in getting a scholarship to the city in 1954. Due to some personal circumstances, Paris became his new home town for the rest of his life.

"De Vente a Alemania, Pepe a ¿Te has venido a Alemania, Pepe? aspectos económicos y culturales de la emigración en dos generaciones distintas","López Fernández, Daniel","En Vente a Alemania, Pepe, el epónimo protagonista decide seguir el camino de muchos de sus compatriotas y abandonar temporalmente España con la intención de ganar más dinero en el extranjero, una esperanza que se ve pronto frustrada. Décadas más tarde, la crisis económica que comenzó en 2008 parece haber dado lugar a una repetición de este capítulo tragicómico de la historia española. No obstante, existen diferencias notables entre ambas generaciones. La migración actual atañe a una generación muy distinta de la que se marchó en los años sesenta y setenta. Se trata, en muchos casos, de inmigrantes con una formación alta y un nivel cultural medio, con conocimientos de idiomas notablemente mejores y con un perfil más internacional y europeo. Para dar constancia del perfil y de las subjetividades de estos nuevos emigrantes españoles, la universidad y el ayuntamiento de Rastisbona en Baviera publicaron en 2015 la colección ¿Te has venido a Alemania, Pepe? En ella se evidenciaban, por una parte, las dificultades surgidas de una economía neoliberal que profundiza las desigualdades sociales, así como la necesidad que tienen los emigrantes españoles de contar esta precariedad, de narrar la experiencia de lo vivido. Por otra parte, los relatos de la colección muestran también la mayor predisposición de esta nueva generación de emigrantes a aceptar, en el marco de un mundo globalizado, las diferencias culturales del extranjero y a adaptarlas como propias, sin por ello dejar atrás el acervo cultural español.","Visual Studies ; German Literature ; landismo ; Ratisbona. ; ""Vente a Alemania ; crisis económica ; Pepe"" ; españolada ; ""¿Te has venido a Alemania ; European History ; Pepe?"". migración ; glocalización ; Spanish Literature",DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/two/6

Imagined Communities in the Orient Mapping New Definitions of Moroccan Spatiality through Western Travelogues,"El Bakkali, Abdelaaziz","The portrayal of Morocco as an exotic location has often been related to the tradition of European Orientalism. From Daniel Defoe to Edith Wharton, the Western presence in Morocco has long been identified by means of several encounters, which has become a central attempt to identify and analyze the country as Oriental. Many of these encounters have resulted in diverse representations that have primarily framed Western ideas about the Oriental world. Morocco, which was identified as an international itinerary of early travelogues about North Africa, has long been a place of Western cultural anthropology and ethnographic surveys. In addressing new definitions of Morocco’s locales, this paper aims to show how the issue of spatiality is discussed through an Orientalist framework. Further, it introduces various narratives that have long stood as cultural and political discursive means. The paper tries to disclose the American nostalgic inclination towards a new age of empire, in which Morocco is imagined as a convenient apposite strategic setting to possess and meet specific ideological interests in the Arab world. To elaborate on the construction of new definitions of spatiality, this paper discloses insights about the following questions: How has Western identity been constructed through de-territorializing European and American ideals? How have some Moroccan locales been turned into international contact zones? This paper delves into these issues by positing a cultural studies approach, relying mainly on qualitative content analysis to rethink alternative possibilities of other perceptions.",Other Arts and Humanities ; Spatiality ; Orientalism ; Mapping ; Identity ; Representation.,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/two/8
Antes de Cook el descubrimiento español de Hawái.

La noticia del hallazgo sembró las dudas y los desacuerdos; pues cómo era posible descubrir islas en esas latitudes sí los españoles llevaban surcando esas aguas más de 200 años entre exploraciones y la ruta de los galeones de Acapulco-Manila y viceversa; abierta desde 1565. Además de que la cartografía antigua señalaba islas con topónimos hispanos a lo largo del Pacífico Norte y, concretamente, en la misma ubicación en la que Cook avistó las islas que él denominó de Sándwich, pero su longitud no era la correcta. A raíz de estas presunciones sobre que esas islas ya las conocían los españoles, se generó un intenso debate historiográfico y elaboración de teorías desde el siglo XVIII al XX; algunas serán rebatidas, otras acotadas al terreno de la conjetura con escasos fundamentos y otras totalmente rechazadas. En este trabajo trazaremos una línea y análisis de las diversas teorías que fueron surgiendo para conocer sus orígenes y alcance; dejando para el final una nueva teoría con aportes inéditos relacionados con el intento de tornaviaje realizado en 1543 por el San Juan de Letrán de la escuadra de Villalobos para alcanzar Nueva España desde las Filipinas.

José Mariano Mociño (1757-1820) Heroic Botanist/Physician of New and Old Spain,"Janota Wasik, Thomas Milan","José Mariano Mociño traveled extensively in New Spain and helped to collect and classify thousands of plants according to modern scientific protocols. In addition, Mociño made significant contributions to science in geology, ethnology, epidemiology, ornithology and horticulture. He was in the vanguard of the study of native Mexican medicinal plants and played a crucial role in the control of infectious disease in the colony and the mother country. Although a contemporary of Alexander von Humboldt, the two never met. Nonetheless, the Prussian traveler was well aware of the accomplishments of Mociño. In his Ensayo politico sobre el Reino de la Nueva España Humboldt wrote “El señor Mociño, who we have already named as one of the compañeros of señor Sessé, and who carried out difficult excursions from the Kingdom of Guatemala to the Northwest coast of Vancouver… [occupied] a very distinguished place among the wise men [of Mexico].” The Mexican born scientist was named the co-leader of the Royal Spanish Botanic Expedition to New Spain (1787-1803) and was instrumental in its inventory of the flora and fauna of the colony. Unfortunately, political turmoil in the mother country prevented publication of its discoveries. The death of his colleagues left the Mexican as sole survivor of the expedition, responsible for completing and protecting its legacy. When Mociño passed from the scene, the accomplishments of the scientific pioneers of the Expedition disappeared to the public for decades or more.",,DigitalCommons,Cal Poly Humboldt,https://img.icons8.com/color/96/document.png,https://digitalcommons.humboldt.edu/xavhumboldt/xavhumboldt/two/10
